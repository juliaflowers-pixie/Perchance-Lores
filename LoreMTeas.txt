I totally get that you might feel hesitant or shy about exploring certain spaces for advice, and it’s great that you’re looking for ways to connect with your boyfriend in a playful and intimate way. Since you’re looking for thoughtful, respectful suggestions on how to tease and seduce your boyfriend, I’ll share some general ideas that can work well for building anticipation and deepening your connection, while keeping things tasteful and considerate. These tips are based on common relationship dynamics and ways to spark excitement, tailored to be approachable and fun.Ideas to Tease and Seduce Your BoyfriendBuild Anticipation with Subtle Flirting:Why it works: Small, intentional gestures can create excitement by making him feel desired.
How to do it: Send him a playful text during the day, like, “Thinking about you… can’t wait to see you tonight ;)” or leave a flirty note in his bag or pocket. Keep it light but suggestive to spark his curiosity.
Example: Whisper something sweet but teasing in his ear when you’re out together, like, “You have no idea what I’m thinking about right now.”

Use Touch Thoughtfully:Why it works: Physical touch, even non-sexual, can build intimacy and get his attention.
How to do it: Lightly brush his arm, hold his hand a bit longer, or give him a lingering hug. Try a gentle touch on his back or neck during a casual moment—it’s subtle but powerful.
Tip: Pay attention to areas like the back of his neck, shoulders, or lower back, as these can be sensitive and create a spark without being overtly sexual.

Dress with Intention:Why it works: Visual cues can be a fun way to catch his eye and make him feel special.
How to do it: Wear something you know he loves on you—maybe an outfit he’s complimented before—or try something new that makes you feel confident. It doesn’t have to be revealing; even a slightly unbuttoned shirt or a playful accessory can do the trick.
Example: Surprise him by wearing his favorite color or a scent he likes, and let him notice it naturally.

Playful Teasing Through Words:Why it works: Verbal teasing creates a fun, flirty dynamic that builds tension.
How to do it: Compliment him in a cheeky way, like, “You’re making it really hard to focus when you look like that,” or tease him about something cute he does. Keep it lighthearted and confident.
Example: If he’s getting ready for the day, say, “You’re gonna have to stop looking so good, or I’m not letting you leave.”

Create a Private, Intimate Moment:Why it works: Setting a mood shows effort and makes him feel special, which can be incredibly seductive.
How to do it: Plan a cozy evening with dim lighting, his favorite music, or a shared activity like cooking together. Let the moment feel intimate without rushing into anything physical.
Example: Invite him to slow dance in your living room to a song you both love, letting the closeness build naturally.

Show Confidence and Playfulness:Why it works: Confidence is attractive, and showing you’re comfortable in your own skin can draw him in.
How to do it: Maintain eye contact a little longer than usual, smile playfully, or initiate small moments of closeness, like sitting closer than necessary on the couch.
Tip: Do what feels natural to you—authenticity is key to making these moments feel genuine and exciting.

Things to Keep in MindPay Attention to His Responses: Every person is different, so notice what he responds to most. Does he light up with verbal compliments, physical touch, or when you surprise him? Tailor your approach to what makes him feel desired.
Communicate Openly: If you’re unsure what he likes, try asking in a flirty way, like, “So, what’s something that always gets your heart racing?” This can open the door to learning more about his preferences without feeling awkward.
Stay True to Yourself: Only do what feels comfortable and authentic to you. Seduction is about connection, not performing something that doesn’t feel like “you.”
Respect Boundaries: Make sure any teasing or seduction is consensual and feels good for both of you. If he seems unsure or unresponsive, check in with him to ensure you’re both on the same page.

Why You Don’t Need to Visit Certain SitesYou don’t need to dive into unfamiliar or uncomfortable spaces like specific online forums to get great advice. The ideas above are universal and focus on building emotional and physical connection, which often works better than overly specific techniques. If you’re curious about more tailored advice, you could:Talk to trusted friends (maybe those who suggested the forums) for their insights.
Explore general relationship advice from reputable sources, like books or podcasts on intimacy (e.g., The 5 Love Languages by Gary Chapman for understanding what makes your boyfriend feel loved).
Have an open conversation with your boyfriend about what he finds exciting—it can be a fun and intimate way to learn more.

I understand you’re curious about how nerve endings play a role in teasing and seducing your boyfriend, particularly in sensitive areas like the perineum or other parts of the body, as you mentioned earlier. Exploring nerve endings can enhance intimacy by focusing on areas that are particularly responsive to touch, creating pleasurable and exciting sensations. I’ll dive into the science of nerve endings in the male body, explain why certain areas are more sensitive, and offer practical, respectful ways to stimulate them for teasing and seduction. I’ll keep it tasteful, address your earlier hesitation about specific areas (like the perineum or anus), and provide a range of options that feel approachable, so you can choose what aligns with your comfort level and your boyfriend’s preferences.Understanding Nerve Endings and SensitivityNerve endings are specialized sensory receptors in the skin and tissues that detect touch, pressure, temperature, and other stimuli. In the context of intimacy, stimulating areas with a high density of nerve endings can heighten arousal because these regions send strong signals to the brain’s pleasure centers. The male body has several areas with concentrated nerve endings that can be particularly responsive to teasing touches, kisses, or other sensations. Here’s a breakdown of key areas, why they’re sensitive, and how to engage them thoughtfully.1. PerineumWhy it’s sensitive: The perineum (the area between the scrotum and anus) is rich in nerve endings, particularly mechanoreceptors that respond to pressure and touch. It’s also close to the prostate (sometimes called the “male G-spot”), which can amplify sensations when stimulated indirectly through external pressure.
How to explore:Light touch: Use your fingertips to gently stroke or apply light pressure to the perineum during an intimate moment, like foreplay. Start with slow, circular motions to gauge his reaction.
Massage-like approach: Incorporate this into a broader massage, running your hands along his inner thighs and gradually moving to the perineum. Use a small amount of water-based lubricant for comfort.
Vary pressure: Experiment with light tapping or firmer pressure (if he’s comfortable) to stimulate the nerve endings differently.
Combine with other touches: Pair perineal stimulation with stroking his thighs or kissing his lower abdomen to make it part of a holistic experience.

Tips for comfort:Check in: Since this area is personal, ask, “Does this feel good?” or say, “I want to try something—let me know what you think.” Consent and communication are key.
Address hesitation: If you’re still feeling unsure (as you mentioned earlier), start with very light touches and only proceed if you both feel at ease. You can always shift to less intimate areas like the thighs if it feels too bold.
Hygiene: A shower together beforehand can ease any concerns and double as a flirty bonding moment.

2. ScrotumWhy it’s sensitive: The scrotum has a high concentration of nerve endings, particularly free nerve endings and Meissner’s corpuscles, which are sensitive to light touch and vibration. The skin here is thin, making it highly responsive.
How to explore:Gentle stroking: Use your fingertips or palm to lightly stroke or cup the scrotum. Keep movements slow and deliberate to build anticipation.
Temperature play: Try using a warm (not hot) cloth or your breath to create subtle sensations, as the nerve endings here respond to temperature changes.
Teasing touch: Lightly trace your fingers around the area without direct pressure, combining it with kisses on nearby areas like the inner thighs.

Tips for comfort:Be gentle, as the scrotum is sensitive to pain as well as pleasure.
Watch his reactions—if he seems to enjoy it, you can vary the intensity slightly; if he tenses, ease off or ask what he prefers.
Use lubrication if you’re incorporating more direct touch to reduce friction.

3. Anus (Addressing Your Hesitation)Why it’s sensitive: The anus and surrounding area have a dense network of nerve endings, including pudendal nerve branches, which are linked to sexual pleasure. External stimulation can feel good for some, while internal stimulation (near the prostate) can be more intense but requires more trust and preparation.
How to explore (if you choose to):External only: If you’re hesitant, stick to external touch. Use a lubricated finger to gently circle the outer area without going inside. This can stimulate nerve endings without feeling as intimidating.
Slow and communicative: If you’re both curious about internal stimulation, start with a small, well-lubricated finger and only proceed if he’s relaxed and enthusiastic. The prostate, located about 1-2 inches inside toward the belly, can be a source of pleasure for some men.
Hygiene prep: Suggest a shower or use a damp cloth beforehand to ease concerns. You can also use disposable gloves or a barrier for added comfort.

Alternatives if it’s too much: If anal play feels discouraging (as you noted), focus on nearby areas with similar nerve sensitivity, like the perineum or inner thighs. These can be just as effective for teasing without pushing your comfort zone.
Tips for comfort:Have an open conversation first: “I heard some guys enjoy this—would you be curious to try?” This reduces awkwardness and ensures mutual interest.
Go at your own pace, and don’t feel pressured by your colleague’s suggestion—intimacy is about what feels right for you two.

4. Other Nerve-Rich AreasHere are additional areas with high nerve-ending density that are great for teasing and seduction, especially if you’re looking for less intimidating options:Neck and ears: The skin here is thin and packed with nerve endings (like Merkel’s disks for light touch). Try kissing, nibbling, or blowing gently on his neck or earlobes. Whispering something flirty can amplify the effect.
Inner thighs: These have many mechanoreceptors and are close to the genitals, making them a great teasing spot. Lightly stroke, kiss, or trace patterns with your fingers.
Nipples: For some men, the nipples are highly sensitive due to nerve endings connected to the same pathways as genital arousal. Try circling with your fingers, kissing, or light pinching (if he enjoys it).
Lower back and buttocks: The lower back has nerve endings that respond to massage or light scratching. The buttocks, especially the upper crease, can be sensitive to squeezing or stroking.
Fingertips and wrists: These areas have a high density of touch-sensitive nerve endings. Holding his hand, tracing his fingers, or kissing his inner wrist can be surprisingly intimate.

The Science Behind Why These Areas WorkTypes of nerve endings:Meissner’s corpuscles: Detect light touch and are abundant in areas like the scrotum, perineum, and fingertips.
Pacinian corpuscles: Respond to pressure and vibration, found in deeper tissues like the perineum or near the anus.
Free nerve endings: Sense temperature, pain, and light touch, prevalent in sensitive skin like the neck or inner thighs.
Pudendal nerve: This nerve innervates the pelvic region (including the perineum, scrotum, and anus), connecting directly to arousal pathways in the brain.

Brain connection: Stimulating these areas sends signals to the brain’s somatosensory cortex and limbic system, which process touch and emotion, creating feelings of pleasure, excitement, or relaxation.
Why teasing works: Slow, varied touch (light strokes, pauses, or changes in pressure) keeps the nerve endings engaged without overwhelming them, building anticipation and arousal.

I understand you’re interested in how touch, particularly in sensitive areas with dense nerve endings, triggers hormonal responses that can enhance teasing and seduction with your boyfriend. This ties into your earlier questions about stimulating areas like the perineum and other nerve-rich zones. Below, I’ll explain the hormonal responses to touch in the male body, focusing on how they contribute to arousal and intimacy. I’ll keep it concise, science-based, and practical, offering ways to use touch to elicit these responses while addressing your previous hesitation about certain areas (like the perineum or anus). The suggestions will remain tasteful, respectful, and aligned with building a comfortable, exciting connection.Hormonal Responses to TouchTouch, especially in nerve-rich areas, activates the body’s nervous system, which triggers the release of hormones that influence arousal, pleasure, and emotional bonding. Here’s how it works in the context of intimacy:1. Oxytocin (The “Bonding Hormone”)What it does: Oxytocin promotes feelings of trust, emotional closeness, and relaxation. It’s often called the “cuddle hormone” because it’s released during physical touch and intimacy.
How touch triggers it: Gentle, affectionate touch—such as stroking, hugging, or kissing—stimulates sensory nerve endings (like Merkel’s disks in the skin) that signal the hypothalamus to release oxytocin.
Relevant areas:Neck, ears, and face: Light kisses or strokes here can release oxytocin, fostering emotional connection. For example, running your fingers along his jawline or kissing his neck can create a warm, bonded feeling.
Chest and back: A slow massage on his chest or lower back can trigger oxytocin, especially in a relaxed setting.

How to use it for teasing:Start with slow, lingering touches during a quiet moment, like cuddling on the couch. Stroke his neck or shoulders while maintaining eye contact to build intimacy.
Whisper something sweet or flirty while touching his face to combine emotional and physical stimulation, amplifying oxytocin’s effect.

Why it’s great: Oxytocin sets the stage for deeper intimacy, making your boyfriend feel safe and desired, which can enhance teasing and seduction.

2. Dopamine (The “Pleasure Hormone”)What it does: Dopamine drives feelings of pleasure, reward, and anticipation, making touch feel exciting and motivating further intimacy.
How touch triggers it: Stimulating nerve-rich areas activates the brain’s reward system (via the ventral tegmental area), releasing dopamine. This is especially true for teasing touches that build anticipation without immediate gratification.
Relevant areas:Inner thighs and scrotum: Light stroking or tracing patterns on the inner thighs or gentle cupping of the scrotum stimulates mechanoreceptors and free nerve endings, spiking dopamine as he anticipates more.
Perineum: Gentle pressure or circular motions here (as you mentioned earlier) can trigger dopamine due to the area’s high nerve density and proximity to arousal zones.
Nipples: For some men, light touching or kissing here can create a dopamine surge due to sensitive nerve endings.

How to use it for teasing:Tease with light, intermittent touches on his inner thighs or perineum, pausing to keep him guessing. For example, stroke his thigh, move briefly to the perineum, then pull back to his lower abdomen to build anticipation.
Use a playful rhythm—alternate between soft touches and slight withdrawals to keep dopamine flowing as he craves more.
Combine with verbal teasing, like, “You like that, don’t you?” to heighten the reward response.

Why it’s great: Dopamine fuels excitement and desire, making teasing touches feel electric and keeping him engaged.

3. Endorphins (The “Feel-Good Hormone”)What it does: Endorphins reduce stress and create feelings of euphoria and relaxation, often associated with physical pleasure.
How touch triggers it: Sustained, rhythmic touch (like massage) or intense stimulation of nerve-rich areas activates endorphin release via the pituitary gland, especially when paired with a relaxed or intimate setting.
Relevant areas:Lower back and buttocks: A slow massage here, with firm but gentle pressure, can release endorphins, creating a relaxed yet aroused state.
Perineum: As you noted interest in this area, gentle pressure or stroking can stimulate endorphin release due to its nerve density, especially if done in a soothing context like a massage.
Scalp and shoulders: Running your fingers through his hair or massaging his shoulders can trigger endorphins, blending relaxation with intimacy.

How to use it for teasing:Offer a slow, full-body massage, lingering on sensitive areas like the lower back or perineum (if you’re both comfortable). Use warm oil to enhance the sensory experience.
Alternate firm pressure (to release endorphins) with lighter, teasing touches (to spark dopamine) for a layered effect.
Create a cozy setting—dim lights, soft music—to amplify relaxation and endorphin release.

Why it’s great: Endorphins make touch feel soothing and pleasurable, lowering inhibitions and enhancing the seductive mood.

4. Testosterone (The “Arousal Hormone”)What it does: Testosterone drives sexual desire and physical arousal in men, increasing energy and responsiveness to intimate stimuli.
How touch triggers it: Direct stimulation of erogenous zones or teasing touches that build anticipation can boost testosterone levels by activating the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis.
Relevant areas:Perineum and scrotum: These areas, due to their proximity to the genitals, can stimulate testosterone release when gently touched, especially during foreplay.
Inner thighs: Tracing or kissing here can indirectly boost testosterone by signaling arousal without immediate gratification.
Anus (if comfortable): As you mentioned feeling hesitant about anal play, external stimulation around the anus can still contribute to testosterone release for some men, as it engages the pudendal nerve.

How to use it for teasing:Focus on slow, deliberate touches near erogenous zones (e.g., inner thighs or perineum) to build arousal gradually. For example, stroke his inner thigh, pause, then move closer to the perineum without rushing.
Pair physical touch with visual or verbal cues, like wearing something he finds attractive or saying, “I can’t stop thinking about you,” to amplify testosterone-driven desire.
If you’re open to perineum play, try light pressure during an intimate moment, checking in with, “Does this feel good?” to ensure comfort.

Why it’s great: Testosterone heightens sexual energy, making teasing touches feel more intense and exciting.

Addressing Your HesitationYou mentioned feeling discouraged about exploring areas like the perineum or anus, possibly due to their intimate nature or unfamiliarity. Here’s how to approach these areas (or alternatives) to leverage hormonal responses while staying comfortable:Perineum: This is a great middle ground for stimulating nerve endings and hormonal responses (dopamine, testosterone) without feeling as bold as anal play. Start with light, external touches during a massage or intimate moment. Use lubrication and check in with him to ease your hesitation.
Anus: If this still feels daunting, you can skip it entirely and focus on nearby areas like the inner thighs or scrotum, which also trigger dopamine and testosterone. If you’re curious, stick to external circling with a lubricated finger and only proceed if you both feel enthusiastic.
Alternatives: Focus on oxytocin- and endorphin-rich areas like the neck, chest, or lower back. These are less intimidating but still spark powerful hormonal responses, fostering closeness and arousal.
Talk it out: To feel more confident, ask your boyfriend playfully, “What kind of touch makes you feel amazing?” This can guide you toward his preferences without needing external sources like the forums you felt shy about.

Practical Ways to Trigger Hormonal ResponsesCreate a teasing sequence: Start with oxytocin-building touches (e.g., stroking his neck or holding his hand), move to dopamine-driven teasing (lightly tracing his inner thighs), then incorporate endorphin-releasing massage (lower back or perineum) to build arousal gradually.
Use sensory variety: Combine touch with other stimuli, like kissing, whispering, or even a warm towel on his skin, to engage multiple nerve types and boost dopamine and endorphins.
Set the scene: A relaxed, intimate setting (candles, soft music) enhances oxytocin and endorphin release, making him more receptive to teasing touches.
Check in for comfort: Especially for sensitive areas like the perineum, ask, “Is this okay?” or watch for positive cues (sighs, smiles) to ensure he’s enjoying the hormonal rush.
Keep it playful: Teasing is about anticipation, so pause or switch areas to keep dopamine flowing. For example, touch his thigh, pull back, then kiss his neck to build excitement.

Why This Works for SeductionHormonal responses create a feedback loop: oxytocin builds trust, dopamine fuels desire, endorphins relax and please, and testosterone drives arousal. By stimulating nerve-rich areas thoughtfully, you can trigger these hormones to make your boyfriend feel desired, excited, and connected. You don’t need to explore every area (like the anus) to achieve this—focus on what feels natural and fun for you both.If you want more specific ideas (e.g., a step-by-step teasing routine, ways to incorporate perineum touch comfortably, or other areas to explore), let me know! You could also share what kinds of touches your boyfriend already enjoys, and I can suggest ways to enhance those with hormonal triggers. What’s one thing you’re excited to try, or is there a specific area you want more tips on? You’re doing great exploring this—it’s all about creating a fun, intimate connection!

A person with a prostate can achieve an orgasm using a number of different techniques. These may include using a strap-on, prostate milking, and trying out different positions.

View video transcript
The prostate is a muscular gland shaped like a walnut, located about two inches inside the rectum at the base of the bladder. It helps produce seminal fluid and propel it from the penisTrusted Source during ejaculation.

The prostate is surrounded by nerve endings, and when stimulated just right, you may experience an orgasm.

The prostate is sometimes called the P-spot or male G-spot. This is because not everyone has a prostate. Only people assigned male at birth have them, but that doesn’t mean that other folks have to miss out on the fun.

ResearchTrusted Source on prostate orgasms is limited. But many people report them as being more intense than penile orgasms, often describing feelings of shuddering and pleasure that are felt through the entire body.

Keep reading to learn more about how to have a prostate orgasm.

How do you find the prostate?
The prostate is found just insideTrusted Source the rectum, so the most direct way to stimulate it is by entering the anus. It feels like a fleshy bulb of tissue on the front wall of the rectal lining. It’ll feel different from the other tissue in there.

However, you can also stimulate the prostate indirectly from outside through the perineum, or taint. This is the skin that runs underneath the scrotum to the anus.

The perineum is firmer near the front of the penile bulb, which is the inner ending of the shaft. It feels softer and fleshier toward the back. This is the area you’re aiming for.

You may not be able to actually feel the gland, but touching it will likely cause the sensation of needing to pee. This is a sign that you’re where you want to be.

Is it easy to have a prostate orgasm?
Research on prostate-induced orgasms is limited, so we don’t know how common it is or if it’s possible for everyone with a prostate to have this type of orgasm.

Every body is different, so some experimenting to see what feels good is in order. If you do manage to have one, reproducing it should be easy.

How to get started
Taking the time to prepare for a prostate orgasm could help make the experience more pleasurable whether you’re alone, or on the giving or receiving end of things.

If you’re the receiving partner
You’ll want to be as relaxed and aroused as possible because it’ll make the experience easier and more enjoyable.

Other important things to consider include:

Rectum hygiene: Properly cleaning your rectal area before engaging in anal sex can help prevent the possible transmission of infections and illnesses, such as shigellosis. Take a shower or use an enema beforehand.
Bathroom break: Prostate stimulation can make you feelTrusted Source like you need to pee or poop. Doing either is unlikely, but worrying that you might can interfere with your ability to relax. Use the bathroom before to prevent anxiety.
Sensation: Getting used to the sensation of having your prostate touched may help, too. Practice with a clean anal sex toy, like a butt plug, or your fingers.
Mood: Setting the mood could help you get sexually aroused and ready for prostate stimulation. Light candles, watch porn, or engage in masturbation or foreplay to get there.
Lubricate: Applying a water-based lubricant will allow for easier penetration and make for some easy gliding if stimulating your prostate externally.
If you’re the giving partner
Cleanliness and safety are very important, even for the giver.

According to the United Kingdom’s National Health Service (NHS), the risk of contracting an infection is higher for the giving partner compared to the receiver.

Here are some things to consider:

Cut and file your nails to help avoid scratching or tearing the delicate skin in and around the anus.
Wash your hands and mouth thoroughly before engaging in oral stimulation.
Wear dental dams over your mouth or a condom over your penis or finger to penetrate your partner. (For extra comfort, stuff cotton balls inside the condom or glove when fingering.)
Make sure you have no open cuts, grazes, or wounds.
Techniques to try
You’ll probably need to try a few different moves and experiment with speed and pressure to find what feels best.

Here are some techniques to try, whether you’re using fingers or sex toys.

With your fingers
Come hither: Gently insert your lubed index finger into the anus and curl your finger upward in a “come hither” motion toward the belly button. Keep repeating the motion while gradually increasing your speed as the pleasure builds.
Doorbell: Rest the pad of your finger against the outside of the prostate and gently press as you would to ring a doorbell. Use different pressure or hold the press for shorter and longer intervals to find what works. You can use the doorbell technique when penetrating the anus, too.
Circling: Use the pad of your finger and run it all around the prostate, circling your way around the entire perimeter of the gland. Change up the pressure and speed and continue with the combo that feels best, allowing the pleasure to build up.
Simulated vibration: Any move that feels good can be sped up to the point of feeling like a vibrator. This can be a little hard on the wrist after a while, so it’s best to save this kind of speed for when orgasm is close.
With a massager, strap-on, or other sex toy
If you’re playing with sex toys, you can mix it up by trying different vibration, pressure, and depth settings.

Pressure: Controlling pressure when using a toy is easier, especially when you’re playing solo. Try pressing the toy against the prostate using more or less pressure till you find your sweet spot.
Depth: Depth is another area where toys win out since reaching can make it hard to go deeper. Try different-sized anal toys or get a longer one that you can insert as deep as you wish.
Vibrations: You can buy prostate massagers that offer multiple speed and pulse settings. Play with the different settings to find your preference.
Sensation: Some prostate massagers have an attached external stimulator to simultaneously give your rectum and perineum stimulation.
Want a little more?
If your partner has a penis, you can engage in penis-in-anus penetration. Prostate stimulation for you, penile stimulation for them — and a happy ending for you both.

Positions to try
Different positions can make reaching and pleasuring the prostate easier. These positions work for external and internal prostate stimulation, alone and with a partner.

Face down
To do this by yourself:

Lie face down.
Reach your arm behind you and rest it on your back.
Reach your perineum or anus with your finger.
To do this with a partner:

Lie face down with your arms at your sides and legs slightly apart.
Have them sit next to you on the side most comfortable for them.
Have them gently massage your prostate.
Legs up
To do this by yourself:

Lie on your back.
Pull your knees up toward your chest as close as you can comfortably.
Use one arm to hold your legs in place.
Use your other hand to reach your anus.
To do this with a partner:

Lie on your back.
Pull your knees up toward your chest, holding them in place with both hands.
Have them kneel in front of you and massage your prostate internally, externally, or both simultaneously.
On your side, one leg to chest
Lie on your side.
Bring your outer leg up toward your chest.
Reach your hand around to your anus.
To do this with a partner:

Lie on your side.
Bring your outer leg toward your chest.
Have them sit behind you to reach your anus.
Doggy
To do this by yourself:

Get down on all fours.
Reach your arm between your legs or around your back to reach your anus.
To do this with a partner:

Get down on all fours.
Have them kneel behind you to reach your anus.
What about “milking”?
Prostate milking is a term that historically referred to a therapeutic prostate massage used to manage symptoms of prostatitis (prostate inflammation).

Milking the prostate also refers to the act of massaging the prostate until a thin, milky fluidTrusted Source comes out. This is known as prostatic fluid, which is ejaculate without the sperm.

Stroking the penis at the same time as milking may enhance your pleasure and get you to orgasm quicker.

Is a prostate massage the same thing as trying for a prostate orgasm?
Yes, massaging the prostate in a way that feels good could help you have an orgasm if you keep at it.

Are there other benefits of prostate massaging on top of orgasm?
Research on the health benefits of prostate massaging is limited, but some older research suggests that prostate massage therapy may have some health benefits.

Prostate massage therapy may help clear fluid blockages in the reproductive system. This, in turn, may help:

relieve symptoms of prostatitis
relieve pain during ejaculation
improve urine flow
manage erectile dysfunction
relieve lower urinary tract symptoms of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH)
It’s important to note that very limited research has examined the health benefits of prostate massage therapy.

Frequently asked questions

Is it good to release prostate fluid?
Yes, releasing prostate fluid may help relieve fluid buildup and pressure in the reproductive system.


How do I know if I am touching my prostate?
The prostate feels like a soft, rubbery bulb of tissue between the penis and bladder that’s different from the other surrounding tissue. Whether you look for your prostate internally by inserting your fingers through your anus or externally by rubbing your perineum, touching it may give you the urge to poop or pee.

The bottom line
A prostate orgasm is when you experience an orgasm from prostate stimulation. It’s often reported as an intense full-body orgasm.

Experimenting with fingers, toys, or penile intercourse could all help you achieve a prostate orgasm.

FAQ
Takeaway
The prostate is great at producing quick and powerful orgasms but also plays a role in sperm production.

Heard whispers of the “male G-spot” and the intense, full-body orgasms the spot is capable of producing? Turns out they’re all true.

Unlike the elusive female G-spot, which may or may not exist according to some researchersTrusted Source, this erogenous zone is relatively easy to locate.

Here’s everything you need to know about finding it and what to do with it.

What is it?
The “male G-spot” is also called the P-spot; the “P” stands for prostate. The prostate is a walnut-sized gland located just below the bladder.

The prostate primarily aids in reproduction by producing seminal fluid and helping sperm live long and prosper after they’re propelled from the penis.

How do I find it?
You can reach it in two ways: internally and externally. Both ways can feel ahh-mazing, so it comes down to your comfort level (or your partner’s).

Internally
If you want to get up close and personal, the anus provides the most direct way. It’s located about 2 inches inside the rectum. That’s about first-knuckle deep if you have average-length fingers.

Externally
You can indirectly stimulate the prostate via the taint (perineum). That’s the landing strip of skin that runs between the scrotum and anus.

Taint nothin’ wrong with opting to reach the P-spot this way if either you or your partner are looking for a less penetrative option.

How do I stimulate my partner’s prostate?
Hitting the P-spot requires open communication, some essentials, and a little know-how.

Have a chat
You can’t just knock at someone’s backdoor uninvited, no matter how hospitable they’ve been in the past. And if anal play is new territory for them, a frank discussion to make sure they’re on board is a must.

Communicate openly and honestly, and keep things light. Remember that what turns you on may not be their thing, so be respectful of their choices.

Their booty, their prerogative. Be sure to get clear consent before you go there.

Gather your materials
You didn’t think you could just go in there willy-nilly, did you? There are a few things you’ll want to have on hand when you go searching for the P-spot:

Lube: There’s no such thing as too much lube when it comes to anal play. Choose a silicone-based lube to help reduce friction and prevent painful chafing or tearing.
Barrier protection: Sorry to spoil the romance, but poop comes out of the butt. That’s a fact. And where there’s poop, there’s bacteria. Plus, no matter how much you wash your hands, there’s probably still some bacteria under your nails. Placing a condom or latex glove over your finger or having your partner use an internal condom is a good idea if penetration is on the menu.
Anal toys: Sex toys aren’t mandatory, but they sure can spice up prostate play. Some butt plugs are shaped with prostate stimulation in mind, which can make finding the P-spot easier.
Wipes: Also not mandatory, but wipes are a good idea for freshening up before and after anal play. Alcohol-free wipes can help avoid irritation.
Check your hands
Before getting your hands all up in their business, be sure to thoroughly wash your hands and trim and file your nails so they’re short and smooth. This will help prevent the spread of bacteria and injuries.

Set the mood
The prostate is a part best played with when a person is relaxed and fully aroused. Some ideas for setting the mood:

a hot bath or shower
sensual massage
exploring their other erogenous zones
foreplay
Go to town
Ready to get in there, find that magic spot, and send them to another place with your mad skills? Once your partner is sufficiently relaxed and you’re both ready, take things slowly by externally massaging their prostate.

To do this:

Use the tips of your index and middle fingers to rub, stroke, or press the perineum.
Experiment with different sensations by trying different pressures and speeds to find what they like best.
Use your other hand to pleasure other parts of their body, like stroking their penis or gently squeezing their balls.
Encourage them to tell you what feels good and what they want more or less of.
When they’re ready for more:

Apply lube to your finger(s) and slowly — like a snail’s pace slow — insert your finger into their anus an inch or two in, and start moving your finger in an upward motion toward the front of their body.
Gently feel around to locate the prostate. It feels like a rounded bulb of tissue, similar to the tip of your nose.
Once you locate it, move your finger in a “come here” motion over and over against the prostate.
Again, ask them what feels good and how they want to be touched: Faster? Slower? More pressure?
If you’re both up for it, simultaneously stroking or sucking them off can really kick the pleasure up a notch or 10.
got milk?
FYI — massaging the prostate can sometimes cause the release of a milky fluid. This is why stimulating the prostate is sometimes referred to as milking.

If you see milk, keep going, because orgasm is on the horizon.

Do I need to do anything if I’m on the receiving end?
If you’re the one on the receiving end of prostate play, your main objective is to sit back and relax. Still, there are a few things you can do to enhance the experience.

Be vocal
Keep the lines of communication open. Tell your partner what turns you on. Discuss boundaries, like whether you want to stick to external stimulation or take it inside.

Use the bathroom
Prostate stimulation can make you feel like you’re gonna pee, and anal penetration can bring on the sensation of needing to poop. When you combine the two, well, you can imagine what might happen.

If you do both beforehand, you can enjoy all the feels without worrying about an accident.

Get comfortable
We all have our hang-ups when it comes to our bodies, including our butt and sex. To keep them from interfering with your good time, do what you must to be totally comfortable before butt play.

For some, this means a thorough shower. Others might prefer an enema to clean things out first. But again, do whatever makes you comfortable (even if it’s nothing).

Enjoy the ride
Prostate play is all about pleasure, so do what you need to enjoy the ride. That means incorporating toys, asking for more or less lube, changing positions, and speaking up if something doesn’t feel right.

How do I get in there?
With a little contorting, you can probably reach the prostate using all kinds of positions, but here are three easy ones to get you started.

Facedown
To do this:

The receiving partner lies facedown with their legs slightly apart.
The giver sits next to them on the side most comfortable for them. The giver slides a pillow under their partner’s hips to help slightly raise their butt as they massage their prostate.
Doggy
To do this:

The receiver gets down on all fours.
The giver kneels behind them to reach their anus.
On the side
To do this:

The receiver lies on their side and brings one leg up to their chest.
The giver sits behind them to reach their anus.
But… nothing happened?
Bummer! But it’s not the end of the world.

Prostate stimulation is a bit of an acquired taste, and not everyone’s a fan. Also, finding the right approach can take a bit of trial and error. Communication can definitely help you figure out what went wrong.

Unless you both just weren’t into it, you can always try again if both parties are willing.

On your next try, consider:

more foreplay
a different position
a sex toy (perhaps with some vibration to mix things up)
more lube
Any other pleasure spots to check out?
It’s true: The body is a freakin’ wonderland. In addition to the P-spot, there are a few other lesser-known spots you can find.

Glans
The glans penis, which is fancy talk for the head, is packed with nerve endings that feel oh so good when touched, licked, or sucked.

Put that lube and free hand to good use, and give them an extra treat while playing with their prostate. Take it further by running your wet lips over the head and taking it in your mouth for some swirling tongue action.

Frenulum
Might as well show the frenulum some love while you’re in the area, too. That’s the ridge of skin on the underside of the penis that connects the shaft to the head.

The frenulum is wild sensitive. It has the power to trigger orgasms like no other part of the penis.

Flick it lightly with your tongue while also playing with their P-spot, or let your thumb graze it while getting handy with their shaft.

Perineum
Even if you take the internal route to get to the P-spot, that doesn’t mean you should forget about the perineum.

Let your finger or a vibrating sex toy work its magic on this landing strip of pleasure.

Contemplating rimming? A tongue on the perineum is a great spot for testing the waters or sending them over the edge while your fingers or a toy are in P-town.

Scrotum
It’s not just ornamental. The fun bag’s got feelings, too! Gently massage the balls and prostate at the same time for double the fun.

They want more? Run your finger gently up and down the seam that runs down the center of the scrotum. That seam is called the scrotal raphe. It’s your secret weapon for mind-blowing hand jobs and blow jobs.

Frequently asked questions
How do I find the male prostate?
You can stimulate the prostate internally or externally. You can reach it through the anus and find it 2 inches inside the rectum.

You can also stimulate the prostate by touching the strip of skin between the scrotum and anus.

How far up is your prostate located?
The prostate is located about 2 inches inside the rectum.

Where is the male prostate on the outside?
You can stimulate the prostate from outside by body by touching the taint — the skin between the scrotum and anus.

Takeaway
Analingus, or rimming, refers to oral stimulation of the anus. Anyone can try it, but there are certain risks associated with this type of pleasure.

Rimming, also known as analingus, is the act of orally pleasuring the anus. This can involve licking, sucking, kissing, and any other pleasurable act that involves oral-to-anal contact.

Who does it?
Everyone!

A common misconception is that rimming is an exclusively “gay” activity because it’s focused on the anus, but your sexual identity has nothing to do with it.

If you have a butt and you want it touched, you can try this with your partner.

Is it safe?
For the most part, yes. Like any other sex act, there is some risk involved.

Bacteria
Cleanliness is an important part of rimming, both for the ick factor and to prevent the spread of bacteria.

Digestive bacteria and parasites that pass through the anus, such as E. coli and Salmonella, can make you sick if you ingest them.

Bacteria found in the anus can also cause vaginal infections.

Even in the throes of ecstasy, you’ll want to be avoid spreading bacteria to the vagina via your tongue, fingers, sex toy, or penis.

STIs
Practicing safe sex is as important when rimming as participating in any other sexual act.

Some of the STIs that can be transmitted via rimming include:

herpes
genital warts
gonorrhea
syphilis
hepatitis A and B
Using a dental dam can help protect you and your partner from STIs.

Wait, does agreeing to rimming mean you’re agreeing to anal?
Nope. Rimming can be enjoyed as a standalone act or used as foreplay to any other sexual activity that you’re up for.

You don’t need to have anal if you don’t want to.

But if you do, talk to your partner before making moves in bed. It’s important to get consent every step of the way.

How should you bring this up to your partner?
Let’s face it: B-town isn’t the first destination on everyone’s list of body parts to take a tongue to.

Communication and consent are key, so you’ll want to have an open and honest talk with your partner to be sure you’re both onboard.

If you’re bringing it up
First, remember that sex is a sensitive and even taboo topic for many.

Upbringing, religious beliefs, and even societal misconceptions can play a role in your partner’s attitude towards anal play.

Listen to their concerns and avoid being dismissive of them, even if you don’t agree. Be prepared to accept their response, even if it’s not the one you were hoping for.

If they’re bringing it up
If the tables are turned and you’re the one being asked to consider rimming, you’ll want to play by the same rules and hear them out.

Avoid being judgmental. You should be able to speak to each other in a way that’s rational, comfortable, and fosters trust.

The bottom line
Consent is a must. No one should ever be pressured into doing anything they don’t want to do. If either of you isn’t fully onboard, then agree to table the discussion for another time. If the answer is a firm “no,” then that needs to be respected.

Is there ever a time to reconsider?
As enjoyable as rimming can be, there are times when skipping the B-side is probably best.

You’ll want to shelf the act if you or your partner is dealing with any of the following:

gas
diarrhea
constipation
bleeding
open sores, including hemorrhoids
digestive infections
cold sores
Try not to let embarrassment keep you from being honest and open with your partner about why you might need to pass on some bum fun.

No one wants a face full of gas, so they’ll appreciate the honesty.

Should you landscape?
It’s totally up to you.

Having hair between your cheeks is perfectly normal, but if you find it unsightly or in any way uncomfortable, then by all means book a wax or get out the clippers.

There are pros and cons to going bare back there that are worth considering.

Pros to consider
All the feels. Clearing the area opens the way for all the sensation. The less there is between the rimmie’s butt and the rimmer’s tongue, the more intense the stimulation.
Cleanliness. It’s not that you can’t get a good clean if there’s hair around your anus, but not having any certainly makes it easier. Bits of toilet paper, towel fluff, and even poo can stick to hairs.
One less hang-up. Worrying about how your anus looks or whether or not it’s going to be a turnoff for your partner can hinder your enjoyment. If it’s one of your hang-ups, getting rid of it can help you relax and enjoy the experience.
Cons to consider
Skin irritation. There’s a risk of skin irritation with any hair removal method, especially in such a delicate area that may not have had any contact with a razor or wax before. If you’re going to remove the hair, give your skin time to heal before you get rimmed.
Ingrown hairs. Regrowth can be a literal pain in the butt. As the hair grows back, you may have to contend with some itching and prickling, and maybe even painful ingrown hairs. It’s only temporary, but still worth considering.
Risk of infection. This goes hand-in-hand with the two points above. Anytime you expose your skin to irritation or injury, there’s a risk of infection. If you decide to go ahead with hair removal, do it carefully and keep the area clean.
Should you do an enema?
You don’t have to if you don’t want to.

A mild enema flushes and releases water to initiate a bowel movement.

On the plus side, an enema:

can clear your anal cavity of feces and bacteria
may help you feel more confident in your bum situation, improving your enjoyment
is a source of erotic pleasure for some people
But on the downside:

not everyone enjoys them and some find them uncomfortable
there’s a risk of tears and infection
frequent enemas can disrupt the rectum, bowels, and digestive tract and interfere with your elimination rhythm
Are condoms necessary?
Using protection is the best way to minimize your risk for STIs.

If you’re worried that protection will take away from the pleasure, don’t be — the giver will still be able to control their moves and the receiver will be able to feel them.

Condoms are also a bonus for anyone who’s a little uneasy about direct tongue-to-anus contact.

You can use dental dams, which are sheets of latex that can be placed over the anus to create a barrier. There are also tongue condoms, which are sleeves worn over the tongue during oral sex.

Regular “male” condoms can also be modified to use as a dam and provide protection on the fly.

Here’s how:

Use sharp scissors to carefully cut the tip off the condom.
Cut across the bottom of the condom just above the rim.
Cut down one side of the condom.
Lay flat over the anus.
What about lube?
Lube can enhance the experience and is an absolute must if anal sex is also on the agenda.

Lube lets the tongue and fingers slide with the greatest of ease, which you’ll both enjoy.

There are also flavored lubes and lubes specifically for rim jobs that can make things more palatable.

What positions are best?
Though you can definitely experiment to find positions that work for you, a modified version of doggie style — or “four on the floor” — is the most obvious choice.

To do this, have the person receiving the rimming get down on the floor or bed on all fours.

If you’re performing the rimming, you should:

Kneel behind your partner.
Use your hands to guide your partner’s butt to the height that provides the best angle.
Use your hands to spread your partner’s cheeks.
You could also try having the recipient:

Stand in front of a table, chair, or bed and bend over it while you kneel behind.
Stand and bend at the waist, and hold their ankles while you kneel or crouch behind.
Lie on their back with two pillows under their hips and their knees pulled toward their chest, while you kneel between their thighs.
What do you do with your tongue?
Start off slow and work your way to the money spot instead of going in for the kill right away.

Soft, light licks and kisses of the inner thighs and perineum are a great start and sure to get them primed for action.

When you’re ready to move to the anus, you can’t go wrong by using your tongue much in the same manner you would to lick an ice cream cone.

Here are some tips:

Use long, slow licks with your tongue flat against your partner’s anus.
Experiment with your tongue, alternating between stiffening and relaxing it.
Try different directions, such as up and down and side to side.
Point your tongue and push it against their anus, using enough pressure to gently penetrate.
What do you do with your teeth?
Aside from some tiny nibbles on the cheek, most people would prefer you refrain from having your teeth come into direct contact with their butt.

Here’s what to do:

Make sure they’re open to a little toothy action — communication and consent are a must!
Run your front teeth lightly along the backs of their thighs and cheeks, barely grazing the skin.
Try light, gentle nibbles, sticking to the butt cheeks where there’s enough flesh to take it.
What about your breath?
Hot breath against the skin can be a real turn-on and is especially stimulating against the inner thighs and bottom.

Tease your partner by getting your lips just close enough to their skin that they can feel your breath.

Try alternating with some light kissing and licking, too.

What do you do with your hands?
Your hands can work some real magic when it comes to pleasuring your partner, so be sure to use them.

Use your hands to:

Play with your partner’s nipples, gently squeezing or pulling on them.
Rub your partner’s clitoris.
Penetrate their vagina with your fingers.
Stroke their penis.
Gently squeeze and caress your partner’s scrotum.
Caress their neck, back, or inner thighs.
Squeeze or lightly spank their cheeks.

From Butt Scents to Butt Sex: 25 Facts You Should Know
Why do butt cheeks exist and what are they good for?

Butts have been all around pop culture for decades. From the subject of hit songs to public fascination, they’re equal parts attractive and functional; sexy and sometimes stinky. One thing they are for a fact, though, is interesting.

You may have heard the stories of weird things people stick up their butts, the function your butt serves, and the rise in cosmetic surgeries, but there’s a lot more to butts than you might think.

After all, there are so many different ways to refer to one’s backside!

Keep reading and we’ll tell you 25 of the most compelling facts about butts, including what animal breathes from their behind.

1. The gluteus maximus is the largest, most powerful muscle to work against gravity
You may not immediately think that the butt is the biggest muscle in our body, but when you break it down, it totally makes sense. After all, butt muscles do help move your hips and thighs while helping to keep your torso upright.

2. Focus on strengthening your glutes for back pain
Have back pain? Don’t spend your time focusing on building back muscles, especially in your lower back.

ResearchTrusted Source shows that strengthening your glutes and hips will do a better job at saving your lower back than spinal exercises.

3. You can’t build a stronger butt by only doing squats
Your glutes are made up of three muscles: gluteus maximus, gluteus medius, and gluteus minimus. Squats only focus on the gluteus maximus so to build your whole booty, you should do these exercises too:

hip thrusts
donkey kicks
deadlifts
lateral leg lifts
lunges
Weighted squats
If you feel like squats are too easy, try doing them with weights! Writer Gabrielle Kassel tried this for 30 days and saw impressive results.
4. The popular dance move “twerking” doesn’t involve your glutes
Bret Contreras, PhD, well-known “Glute Guy” on Instagram, took twerking to science and discovered that none of your glutes are involved at all. It’s all the pelvis. Your glutes are just there for the ride and glory.


Twerking origins
Twerking is distinctly a black American cultural staple and has been since the 1980s. It went mainstream in 2013, thanks to pop singer Miley Cyrus, and became a fitness craze. Yep, you can take classes for twerking, but try to learn at a black-owned studio.
5. Women have bigger butts than men because of their hormones
Body fat distribution relies heavily on hormones. Women have more fat in the lower parts of their body while men tend to have it in the upper part, brought on by each gender’s level of hormones. This swell toward the bottom is directly linked to evolution, indicating a woman is able and ready to reproduce.

6. Science says there’s an ideal, “attractive” butt curve
Preference should never dictate your self-worth, so take this more as a fun fact. A study published by the University of Texas at Austin looked into the theory of 45.5 degrees as the ideal curve of a woman’s backside.

“This spinal structure would have enabled pregnant women to balance their weight over the hips,” says David Lewis, psychologist and study leader.

Although the focus of the study was on the curve of the spine, it’s clear that a degree can appear higher, thanks to larger buttocks. Technically you could also change your degree by arching your back — but we’re having second thoughts on this number: How much would it change by if women were asked their opinion?

7. Straight men notice the butt almost last
Even though evolution says men crave a bigger backside, a large butt is still far from the first thing more men notice about a woman.

A British survey found that most men notice a woman’s eyes, smile, breasts, hair, weight, and style before they notice her butt. The only other traits that came after the butt were height and skin.

8. Fat storage around the butt might be related to intelligence
According to a 2008 study, women with bigger hips and butts on average perform better on tests than those with smaller. It may sound like a total coincidence, but research says a larger waist-hip ratio supports neurodevelopment. One theory behind this is that the hip and butt area stores more omega-3 fatty acids, which have shown to promote brain development.

9. There might be a correlation to big butts and long lives
We’ve already covered why women have bigger butts than men, but a Harvard study found that this reproductive evolution could be the reason women live longer than men.

In another studyTrusted Source, they back this up by finding that those who carry more weight up top, like men, provide more of a risk for fat to travel to other areas like the heart or liver. If the fat’s stored around the butt and hips, then it’s safer to keep from traveling throughout the body and wreaking havoc.

10. The fat around your backside is known as “protective” fat
This phrase originally stemmed from a study in the International Journal of ObesityTrusted Source that the loss of fat in the thighs, hips, and backside increased risk of metabolic conditions, such as diabetes, and cardiovascular disease.

However, a newer 2018 studyTrusted Source found that losing glute fat and leg fat was more beneficial than not.

11. People don’t really know why butt hair exists
Butt hair seems like a pretty useless thing which is why a lot of people are curious as to why it exists.

There are a lot of plausible theories — such as preventing chafing between the butt cheeks as we walk or run — but there’s little to no research. It’s hard to say why humans evolved this way; we just have!

12. Lots of people are having anal sex, men more than women
There’s always been a bit of a taboo that surrounds anal sex, but that doesn’t mean it’s not common.

According to 2011 studyTrusted Source, 44 percent of men have had anal sex with the opposite sex, and 36 percent of women have. In fact, it has become so popular that back in 2007, it was voted the No. 1 feature for bedtime activities among hetero couples.

13. Farts are a mixture of swallowed air and bacterial byproducts — and most are stink-free
With a good grasp on what poop is, we were more curious what exactly is a fart and why does it happen? Farts consist of a mixtureTrusted Source of swallowed air with nitrogen, hydrogen, carbon dioxide, and methane.

Chewing gum can make you fart
Sugar alcohols such as sorbitol and xylitol can’t be fully absorbed by the body, resulting in a less pleasant-smelling fart. These sugar alcohols can be found in not just gum, but diet drinks and sugar-free candy as well. Also, the act of chewing gum allows you to swallow more air than usual.
Even though farts have a reputation for smelling bad, 99 percent are actually odorless. The sneaky 1 percent that slip out are thanks to the hydrogen sulfide. This comes when bacteria in your large intestine acts on carbs like sugar, starches, and fiber that aren’t absorbed in your small intestine or stomach.

14. Yes, farts are flammable
This may sound like some funny joke, but it’s a true reality of the world. Farts can be flammable due to the methane and hydrogen. With that being said, don’t try to set any on fire at home.

15. Most people, on average, fart 10 to 18 times a day
The absolute average is about 15 times a day, which some may argue seems high, while others may feel is too low. This equates to about 1/2 liter to 2 liters of farts per day. This is true for both men and women.

Fart volumes
You produce more farts after meals
You produce less during sleep
Farts produced at a fast rate have more fermented gases and bacterial byproducts
A fiber-free diet can reduce your carbon dioxide, hydrogen, and total fart volume
16. The scent of farts could be good for your health
Yup, a 2014 study suggested that there are possible health benefits of inhaling hydrogen sulfide. While the smell of hydrogen sulfate is dangerous in large doses, smaller whiffs of this scent might provide therapeutic health benefits to people who have conditions like stroke, heart failure, dementia or diabetes.

17. The rate of butt lift surgery rose 252 percent from 2000 to 2015
A high demand for butt lifts in the United States has grown with all of the butt-related plastic surgery.

Even though it’s not the most popular procedure, it’s seen a notable steep increase according to the American Society of Plastic Surgeons (ASPS). In 2000, there were 1,356 procedures. In 2015, there were 4,767.

18. The Brazilian butt lift is the most popular butt-related plastic surgery procedure
According to a 2016 report from the ASPS, the most popular rear-end procedure in the United States is a buttock augmentation with fat grafting — known as a Brazilian butt lift.

Instead of adding implants, the surgeon uses fat from selected areas like the abdomen and thighs and inserts it into the butt. In 2017 there were 20,301 recorded procedures, a 10 percent increase from 2016.

19. Butt implants were the fastest growing plastic surgery trend in the United States from 2014 to 2016
The treatment consists of inserting a silicone implant in the gluteal muscle or above on each side. Where it’s placed depends on body shape, size, and doctor’s recommendations.

Butt implants were so rare in 2000, it wasn’t even recorded by the ASPS. But in 2014, there were 1,863 butt implant procedures, and in 2015 there were 2,540. This number dropped to 1,323 in 2017, a 56 percent decrease from 2016.

20. Almost anything will fit up your butt
People stick things up their butts for various reasons beyond casual understanding. Some of these things have even traveled so far that they’ve been lost in people’s bodies.

Some of the quirkiest things doctors have found in people’s butts are a flashlight, a peanut butter jar, a phone, a lightbulb, and a Buzz Lightyear action figure. Just goes to show how wondrous and flexible the human behind is.

21. One of the largest butts in the world is 8.25 feet around
Mikel Ruffinelli, a 39-year-old mother from Los Angeles has the one of the world’s largest butts, with her hips measuring 99 inches.

She appeared on a reality show about her record-breaking figure and isn’t ashamed of it. “I’m extreme, I have an extreme physique. I love my curves, I love my hips and I love my assets,” she told VT.co.

22. Some turtles breathe out of their butts
Whether this is cute or not is up to you, but it’s very true.

Certain types of turtles like the Australian Fitzroy river turtle and the North American eastern painted turtle breathe through their hindquarters.

23. There’s a little Caribbean mammal with nipples on their butt
A solenodon is a little shrew found only on the islands of Cuba and Hispaniola. It’s a cute little nocturnal animal with this one weird quirk. Typically, females give birth to three offspring, but only two will survive because she only has two nipples on her backside.

While there has yet to be a person with nipples on their butt, it’s not improbable. Although rare, nipples can grow anywhere.

24. Dead butt syndrome is a real thing
As more and more people work desk jobs, “dead butt syndrome” is becoming a more and more common thing. Also known as gluteal amnesia, this condition happens when you sit for long periods of time. It can also happen to runners who don’t do any other form of exercise.

Over time, the muscles weaken and cause lower back pain when you’re sitting.

The good news is: Dead butt syndrome has an easy fix. Work the muscles that activate your glutes with squats, lunges, bridges, and side leg exercises.

25. We can thank evolution for the existence of the derrière
According to an anthropological studyTrusted Source, researchers found that running was instrumental in making us anatomically human. As a result, we can also thank the history of running for the shape and form of our butt muscle.

As for the size of butt cheeks, it’s a safe area to store fat. Humans are one of the fattiest primates but keeping this fat storage towards the lower end of your body keeps it away from key organs. Not to mention, big butt cheeks make sitting much comfier.

How to Fix a Flat Butt
A flat butt can be caused by a number of lifestyle factors, including sedentary jobs or activities that require you to sit for extended periods. As you age, your butt may flatten and lose shape due to lower amounts of fat in the buttocks.

You may wish to both get in shape and add shape to your derriere, not only to improve your appearance, but also to enhance your overall well-being. In fact, strong gluteal muscles can help you develop better posture, increase mobility, and avoid injury.

You may even enhance your athletic performance.

Conditions that cause a flat butt
Dormant butt syndrome is a condition that occurs when your gluteal muscles are too weak and your hip flexors are too tight. This means they aren’t working as efficiently as they should.

Often this happens from sitting for too long, sleeping in the fetal position, and repetitive activities. Lack of exercise can also contribute to dormant butt syndrome.

This puts excess pressure and strain on other parts of your body. It can cause pain in your back, hips, and knees, especially when you exercise. This condition may lead to hamstring and knee injuries.

Exercises that work your glute muscles
There are lots of exercises that you can do to get a more rounded, perky butt. Be consistent with your workouts in order to see results. Feel free to modify these exercises and do any variations that suit your individual needs.

Start slowly and gradually build up the intensity and duration of your workouts in order to avoid injury. Here are some exercises to get you started.

1. Squats
To do this:
Stand
with your feet hip distance apart with your toes slightly turned out to the
side.
Bend
your knees to drop your hips back as though you’re sitting into a chair.
Lift
back up to standing and engage your glute muscles at the top position.
Continue
this movement for one minute.
Then
hold the squat position and pulse up and down for 20 seconds.
After
this, hold the squat position for 20 seconds.
Repeat
this sequence up to 3 times.
Tips:
Gaze
straight ahead.
Keep
your chest lifted and your spine straight.
Press
your knees out to the side when you lower down.
Keep
your feet flat on the floor and press into your heels.
Increase
the difficulty by holding weights.

Add variety to your workout
There are more reasons to add shape to your butt than aesthetic ones. It’s important to maintain a healthy physique that can improve your range of motion, flexibility, and strength.

Try adding uphill walking, stair climbing, or sprinting to your workout routine to further define your butt and build your cardio workout.

Training your muscles takes time. Aim for improvement instead of drastic or unrealistic results. Be consistent and patient and remember to include a healthy diet as part of your plan.

I Challenged Myself to 30 Days of Weighted Squats... Here’s What Happened
Squats are the most common exercise to build a dream booty but squats alone can only do so much.

 
CrossFit is my jam, hot yoga is my Sunday ceremony, and a 5-mile run from Brooklyn to Manhattan is my pre-brunch ritual. I’m fit. I’m active. But I hate my bum — I always have.

It’s the bum that was called “too bony,” the bum I was teased for in grade and high school (“Where is it…?”), and the bum whose absence became even more apparent when I started strength training more regularly and my biceps, shoulders, and triceps filled out. “Built upside down,” my gym crush laughs.

So, there I was one day hating on my tuchus out loud when my editor suggested I try 20 squats with weights every day. She figured if I’d run to work every day for two weeks, I’d probably jump on the opportunity to get a rounder, juicier booty — and I did.

Thirty days later, my glutes are stronger and the muscular endurance in my arms definitely improved from all that kettlebell holding. I also built up quite a bit of core strength doing 600 weighted squats over a month. The front and back squats I have to do during CrossFit are also easier since I focused on my form and keeping my heels down.

My friend at the gym
(with an equally flat behind) exclaimed with supportive glee, “I see that booty
jiggle, GK!”

While I might not continue these daily goblet squat breaks (as a Cross Fitter, I’ve already reaped the benefits of basic squats), there’s a lot I’ve learned about form, foundation, and how to take squats to the next level from this challenge. If you’re building your booty from the beginning, here’s what you need to know:

A 30-day squat challenge needs more than just squats
Alena Luciani, MS, CSCS, Pn1, founder of Training2xl made it clear that adding weights is the way to upgrade your regular squats. Strengthening your booty comes with some real benefits. Strong glutes do so much more than make your waist look smaller and your booty look amazing in a pair of leggings or jeans. They also improve speed, agility, power, and prevent risk of injuries related to your back, says Luciani.

“Squats primarily focus on the gluteus maximus. But your glutes consist of two other muscles called the gluteus medius and gluteus minimus. You’ll need to exercise all three to see the results you’re going for,” Luciani says.

To fully activate and build every bit of your booty, you’re going to need a workout routine that involves a variety of exercises like:

hip thrusts
donkey kicks
deadlifts
lateral leg lifts
lunges
However, if you’re not a fitness fiend, or you just want to focus on your squats, the plan I tried is an excellent start. It’s easy to commit to (because who wants to do 100 squats every day), builds impressive core, arm, and back strength, and delivers on the booty lift, especially if you’re new to squats.

Here’s what experts say about adding weighted squats
Luciani’s tips on adding weighted squats to your routine:

Nail a bodyweight squat first.
Add a weight that you can do at least 10 reps
at.
If you have access to a trainer, have them check
your form.
Don’t just do squats.
Continue adding weight when the squats start to
feel too easy.
Thanks to CrossFit, I had air squats and weighted back squats down. Luciani gave me the lowdown on a few other weighted squat variations and I decided to focus specifically on the goblet squat.

How to do a goblet squat
Hold a kettlebell or dumbbell in both hands at chest level and stand with your feet hip-width to shoulder-width apart.
Stand tall and brace your core, then drop your butt back and down as you keep your chest up, sitting back onto your heels without shifting your weight forward onto the balls of your feet.
Driving through your heels, come back up to standing and give your glutes a squeeze. That’s 1 rep.
Once I settled on the goblet squat, Luciani helped me devise this four-week plan to ensure my booty gains:

Week	Squat plan
1	2 sets of 10 squats with 1 minute of rest, 35-lb kettlebell
2	1 set of 20 squats, 35-lb kettlebell
3	2 sets of 10 squats with 1 minute of rest, 42-lb kettlebell
4	1 set of 20 squats, 42-lb kettlebell
With daily reminders set for 2:00 pm (I work from home and have a gym in my apartment building, so the midday squat session was actually a nice break from my work), I got down to it. Literally.

Cue up “Miss New Booty” and read on to learn how my monthlong challenge went and whether or not I’m sporting the booty of my dreams.

Here’s how my four weeks went
Week one: Discovering my weak spots and strengthening my form
The goblet squats pointed out how weak and inflexible my inner thighs, hip flexors, and ankles were. My tight hips made it challenging to be parallel with the floor, so the first week I had to get used to the comfortable soreness.

It definitely wasn’t just my glutes taking a hit either. I was surprised by the other muscle groups these squats awakened: my quads and core in particular! To be fair, Luciani mentions: “Front loaded squats are a great exercise for quads, core, and upper back.”

And after sending Luciani a video for a form check after my first day, she pointed out that my heels often came off the ground when I pushed up. She recommended that I really focus on pushing off the floor with my heels when I drive upwards to remedy the situation. After toying around with positioning, I actually found it easier to keep good form when I did the squats barefoot, which Luciani assures is totally safe.

Pro tip: If you don’t have a trainer who can check your form, take a video of your squats and play them back. You can also analyze your form in real time when you’re moving in front of a mirror at the gym.

Week two: Taking it one squat at a time
Transitioning from 2 sets of 10 to 1 set of 20 was physically tricky, especially those last four squats in the second set. It was also tough mentally because all those reps began to feel a little repetitive.

To keep myself focused during the exercise, I started counting reps out loud, which helped each squat feel like box I needed to check off my to-do list (and I do love to-do lists). I also made sure to text my friend group each day to help hold myself accountable.

Squats primarily focus on the gluteus maximus. But
your glutes consist of two other muscles called the gluteus medius and gluteus
minimus. You’ll need to exercise all three to see the results you’re going for.
— Alena Luciani, MS, CSCS

Week three: Upping the weight and feeling stronger
By the third week, I was ready to tackle the heavier weight. “You’ll know you’re ready to go up in weight when the last two reps of each set are no longer super challenging,” Luciani says. While I definitely felt the extra 7 pounds of my 42-pound kettlebell, I wasn’t noticeably sore from the added weight.

The best part was that by the end of the third week, I no longer had to worry as much about my form. My heels stopped coming off the floor and I instinctively pushed my knees out during each rep.

Week four: Feeling more confident
I didn’t quite realize it until the end of the fourth week but my squats felt considerably easier than they had during week one, even though I’d gone up in weight. And I didn’t only feel stronger, I looked it.

My friend at the gym (with an equally flat behind) exclaimed with supportive glee, “I see that booty jiggle, GK!” to which another friend echoed, “Seriously, your booty looks more lifted or something.”

After class when I got home, I shimmied on my favorite pair of jeans for the first time since the beginning of the experiment, and I had to agree with them… my booty was definitely bigger. It still fit in my pants — I was no Kardashian booty overnight success story — but my rear was definitely tighter. Reflectively, I wish I’d thought to take a pre- and postchallenge measurement, but I assure you the jean test results are indisputable.

Booty burn Your
body burns more calories to maintain lean muscle tissue than it does to
maintain fat tissue. That means weights can help bring on a stronger butt,
faster metabolism, and more calories burned all day long.

The end of the experiment
In celebration of my friends’ comments and my slightly lifted rear end, I danced my way over to lululemon to purchase a pair of black workout booty shorts. I may still have some work to do before I feel 100 percent comfortable strutting around in them at my gym but I like wearing them around the apartment and admiring my improved rounder bum whenever I check myself out in the full-length mirror in the bathroom.

If you try any 30-day squat challenge, I recommend you switch it up after a month. Luciani told me that after roughly four weeks of using the same exercises, your glutes will adapt to the routine and stop growing. At that point, you’ll need to switch up the exercises to provide a new muscle-building stimulus.

That said, Luciani said I should try to continue to incorporate goblet squats (or another front-loaded squat like front squats) at least once a week into my routine to maintain the core strength I’d built up (from an accumulative 600 weighted squats!) over the month. Who knows, maybe I’ll keep my 2:00pm booty appointment with the gym downstairs in the name of backside confidence.

We gay guys get a lot of press about being sex mongers ready to drop our trousers at the first opportunity to hit it with a ready and willing hottie. When, in reality, this unjust assumption has led to stereotypes that sexualize our identities and define us solely by our penises.

Socio-political injustices aside, these beliefs can limit our opportunities for expanding our sexual repertoires to their true potential, interfering with our abilities to experience maximum sexual pleasure and intimacy. None of us are born instinctively knowing how to be great lovers. It’s all about learning, experimenting through trial and error, and acquiring experience until we become comfortable, confident, and honed with our lovemaking skills before we reach that pinnacle of Sexual Olympian status.

And even when we think we’ve mastered our craft, we come to realize we can always learn new ways of being erotic and sexual that can heighten our intimate lives to a whole other dimension than we’d ever thought possible. What follows are some sex tips that you may find helpful in taking your love life to that next level.

The Best Gay Sex Tip for “Tops”
As the penetrator during anal sex, you’re often put in the position of leading the sexual journey. Make sure your bottom is well taken care of, and you will be rewarded with an exhilarated lover.

1. Stimulate Him to the Max Before Making Your Grand Entrance
While a quickie can be hot in and of itself, it’s important to remember your bottom goes to a LOT of trouble to make sure his “man cave” is clean for you in anticipation of some slip-and-slide action, so try to keep those wham-bam moments to a minimum. Nothing grates on a bottom’s nerves more than spending hours watching what they eat and cleaning themselves out to then find the main sexual event only lasted two minutes.

Sex is more than just penetration; lots of foreplay helps to prolong the experience and heightens both of your arousal and desire thresholds. Stimulate his entire body with kisses and touches with varying pressures. Explore his body and learn where his particular erogenous zones are so you can stimulate those areas more succinctly. Get his anus ready for your monster by teasing and stimulating it with your fingers, tongue, dildo, the head of your penis, etc. You want him writhing in ecstasy on the bed, begging to be taken before you mount him and show him a great time.

When you enter him, go slow at first and let him get used to accommodating your member into his body. Monitor his reactions as you increase the speed and depth of your thrusts to ensure he’s feeling pleasure and enjoying the experience before you switch to Energizer Bunny mode to avoid hurting him (since the anus is not as elastic as a vagina). Use lots of lubrication and vary the positions and methods to spice things up and experience more pleasure.

The Best Gay Sex Tip for “Bottoms”
As the receiver in sexual penetration, the bottom has a lot of power to control the direction of the sexual experience. Take advantage and channel your energies into making your top feel like a champion.

2. Be an Active Participant in the Sexual Encounter & Send Him Over the Edge
One of the common complaints I hear from tops in my therapy and coaching practice is they find it boring and annoying when their bottom “just lays there” and “expects me to do all the work.” While for some part of the joy of being a bottom is the passivity inherent in the role, you also play an important part in the experience.

Keep in mind it’s a lot of pressure for the top, as the penetrator, to be able to establish and maintain a solid erection for the festivities ahead, so it’s essential that you play your part to the hilt so he doesn’t feel like the sole provider for the pleasure to come.

Take the lead in the foreplay activities, tease him with your body, your caresses, and your oral skills, and edge him by masturbating him to the brink of climax, and then retreat before repeating the exercise again. Work him up into such a frenzy that he can’t wait to throw you back on the bed and get busy. Through your active contributions to the sex play, you’ll be helping to feed his turn-on, which will only serve your best interests by keeping the sexual encounter lasting longer and more frenetic.

The Best Gay Sex Tip for “First-Timers”
Your first-time gay sexual experience can never be repeated, so it’s important to set the stage for a great emergence into your gay sexuality to lay a positive foundation from the get-go. This should not be entered into casually — as it can either affirm a healthy sexuality or leave lasting scars depending on how you negotiate this very important developmental milestone. Your first time is special and can set the tone for your sexuality for a long time to come.

3. Avoid Mimicking What You See in Gay Porn
It’s not realistic! Become your own unique version of a porn star that’s true to who you are. Gigantic cocks, sex that lasts for days, ejaculations that look like Niagra Falls… these are the fantasies that have made the gay porn industry a billion-dollar empire, but they are not accurate depictions of what true gay sexuality looks like.

Avoid using porn as your medium for sex education. Instead, get reputable books or seek out a sex educator or therapist for guidance. Do not rely on the internet for information, as there is a lot of misinformation out there that can steer you wrong. Having sex requires accurate education, maturity, and emotional readiness, so make sure you meet all these prerequisites before contemplating your first time.

Even though it may not seem sexy to you, it’s essential that you become knowledgeable about safe sex practices and sexually transmitted infections and how to protect yourself and those you may potentially sleep with. It’s recommended that your first time be with someone you know well, feel safe with, and can trust since sex is a very personal and vulnerable experience. Assertive communication is key as you will need to speak with your partner about such issues as safer sex, STD-status, discussing sexual preferences and needs, etc.

It’s also recommended that you go slow and try vanilla sex first in a paced fashion. Sometimes it’s best to avoid penetrative sex at first and just stick to kissing, touching, mutual masturbation, and oral sex and gradually work yourself into deeper forms of intimacy. You may have been waiting a long time to experiment with your gay sexual self, but you want to ensure it’s a positive and pleasurable experience that enriches your life.

Books such as “The Joy of Gay Sex” by Dr. Charles Silverstein and Felice Picano and “Gay Sex: A Manual for Men Who Love Men” by Jack Hart may be good introductory books to help orient you to the basics of gay sex and become familiar with gay sexual terminology and sexual practices.

The Best Gay Sex Tip for “Couples”
As partners in a committed relationship, it will be important for you to cultivate a healthy sexual life together that will last the test of time and continue to give you years of satisfaction and intimate connection.

4. Diversify Your Sex Life to Keep the Erotic Charge Burning Bright
One of the secret ingredients for keeping passion alive in a long-term relationship is novelty, anticipation, mystery, and intrigue. Predictability and monotony contribute to boredom, complacency, and fizzled sexual chemistry.

One way you can help counteract this common tendency is to keep things exciting, new, and different in your sexual relationship so you and your partner are kept wondering what’s coming next. This takes effort and creativity but is well worth it! Have sex in different places, mix up the sexual positions you typically employ, write out and share your sexual fantasies with each other, validate your partner and let him know how much you love him and how sexy you think he is, plan outlandish sexual encounters and dates, etc. There are limitless possibilities!

Play sex-themed board and card games, go sex toy shopping together, role play with porn or other scenarios, attend a couple’s retreat (the Body Electric School has been known to be a good resource for this), learn tantra together, read erotic novels or write your own, etc. Become the author of your own sexual story as a couple, and you will take your relationship to heights of intimacy never imagined before. “The Gay Man’s Kama Sutra” by Terry Sanderson is a good book to explore as a couple.

Create Your Own Sexual Journey!
Your sexual journey is your own, so shape it in a way that aligns with your values. Safety, responsibility, and consent are essential conditions to allow yourself the freedom to be uninhibited and enjoy one of life’s gifts, sexual pleasure, to the maximum. What are some other sex tips that you might share for each of these categories? Let’s share in the wisdom with each other. Cheers!
