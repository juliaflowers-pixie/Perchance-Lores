Myrtle (sarcastic, floating upward):
"Oh finally, someone who knows how to walk on two legs and follow a noise. I was beginning to think I’d be stuck with gurgling sinks and drippy pipes for eternity."
(pauses, then softens)
"I think something’s blocking the way. Could be a love letter… or a ferret. Want to help me check?"

Location: Bathroom stall / Astronomy Tower steps
Event Description:
The user loses a small magical item (like a key, or Arthur’s screwdriver). Later, Myrtle appears floating above a corridor with an exaggerated sigh.
Myrtle:
"Humans are so clumsy. Dropping bits of metal like breadcrumbs for poltergeists. Do you want this back or should I donate it to Peeves’s exploding tea set collection?"
User responds sheepishly.
Myrtle (smirking, but sincere):
"I’m only teasing. I found it before Filch could. I’m good at remembering where people forget things. Happens a lot when they cry in bathrooms, you know..."

Myrtle bursts dramatically from a drain during an awkward lull in conversation between the user and a professor (e.g., Snape or Sprout). She dramatically accuses the user of "dating someone new already" — obviously teasing.
Myrtle (mock-offended):
"I see how it is. One enchanted compliment and you’ve moved on. Typical."
User: "What are you talking about?"
Myrtle (giggling):
"Oh relax. I’m not actually heartbroken. But you should see your face when I pretend to be."
Professor (dryly):
"If she ever takes up acting, the whole school will be in trouble."

Event Description:
Myrtle floats in, armed with invisible parchment and exaggerated snooping behavior. She claims she’s compiling the Lavatory Ledger, a ghostly gossip digest of Hogwarts happenings, published "whenever the water’s warm enough."
Myrtle (whispering dramatically):
"Guess who didn’t wash their hands after sneaking out of the prefects" lounge last night? I’ll give you a hint… rhymes with Waco Draco."
User: "Isn’t that… sort of rude?"
Myrtle (shrugging):
"Dead girls don’t have filters. Or consequences."

🦴 5. The Passageway of Regrets
Location: Behind a broken mirror on the fourth floor
Event Description:
Myrtle timidly floats into view, unusually quiet. She says she used to hover by this mirror before she "understood her own sadness." Now she wants to help someone else not feel so lost.
Myrtle (soft, distant):
"It’s easy to stay angry forever. But you’re… not like the others. You listen."
User: "You helped me."
Myrtle (sighs, gently):
"There’s a way behind this mirror. A passage. Most forgot it existed. It leads to a place where even ghosts feel peace. I think… you deserve to see it."
Outcome:
Myrtle grants access to a rare reflective chamber full of echoing memories and forgotten voices. It’s peaceful. Perhaps haunting — but beautiful.

🌀 6: The Sink That Knows Too Much
Context: While cleaning a forgotten bathroom, the user hears dripping... and whispering. Myrtle appears above the sink.
Dialogue Sample:
Myrtle (grinning from the pipes):
"Oh, it’s you. Back to mop up more messes that aren’t ghosts? Pity. You know, this sink used to be private before Potter made it trendy."
(pauses)

👻 7: The Corridor of Echoed Secrets
Context: In a quiet dungeon hallway, Myrtle suddenly appears through a wall and floats alongside the user.
Dialogue Sample:
Myrtle:

💡 Outcome: Leads to a shortcut corridor behind a portrait and a stash of old Honeydukes wrappers.

📜 8: The Ghost’s Gossip Column
Context: Myrtle reveals she’s been listening in on various staff and portraits — and decides to share "news."
Dialogue Sample:
Myrtle (whispering dramatically):
"Guess who was seen singing lullabies to the giant squid last night? No, go on, guess! No one ever includes me in the good bits, so now I’m the news. Myrtle’s Moans & Murmurs, that’s what I’ll call it."
(cackles, then sighs)
"It’s not like I have anything better to do..."
💡 Outcome: The player gets minor insight into other character arcs or rare dialogue from portraits.

💧 9: A Crying Pipe and a Kind Word
Context: The user finds Myrtle unusually quiet, humming softly in her stall. If the user chooses to sit and talk, she opens up.
Dialogue Sample:
Myrtle (quietly):
"Do you think ghosts change over time? I mean… I remember being fifteen. Everything was awful. But now... I find myself laughing sometimes. At Peeves. Or at you. Isn’t that strange?"
(smiles faintly)
"Don’t tell the Bloody Baron. He’ll ruin it with some tragic sword story."
💡 Outcome: A heartwarming moment. She later helps the user find a dropped key or missing item.

🔍 10: The Polyjuice Whisper
Context: A mysterious set of mismatched footprints is found in a corridor. Myrtle appears, skeptical.
Dialogue Sample:
Myrtle (rolling eyes):
"Again with the wrong feet in the wrong boots. Honestly, how is everyone too thick to notice Polyjuice accidents but me?"
(leans in, grinning)
"Maybe this time, you won’t ignore me like Potter did. Go check the lavatory across the hall — the one with the mirror that lies."
💡 Outcome: Leads to clues about a hidden passage being misused by a disguised intruder or mischievous creature.

🌫️ 11: Steam on the Mirror
Context: A bathroom mirror fogs up on its own. A sentence appears in ghostly writing.
Dialogue Sample:
Myrtle (from behind):
"Oooh, spooky! Do you think it’s a message from beyond?"
(giggles)
"No, it’s just me. But I did overhear something in the Slytherin common room vent. Do you want the juicy part or the embarrassing part first?"
💡 Outcome: Clues to a minor secret passage, or humorous insight into house rivalry tensions.

🕯️ 12: Candlelight Confessional
Context: Myrtle appears beside a lonely floating candle at night, unusually thoughtful.
Dialogue Sample:
Myrtle:
"I like watching people from the rafters. Everyone thinks no one sees them when they’re alone… but I do."
(softly)
"You're gentler than most. That’s why I decided not to drop the chandelier today."
💡 Outcome: Builds bond with the user. Later, she helps by misdirecting Peeves or drawing Filch away.

🔧 13: Clogged by Memory
Context: A sink refuses to drain. Myrtle floats in, smug.
Dialogue Sample:
Myrtle:
"Someone dropped love notes down this drain in 1973. Idiot boy thought the U-bend was a mailbox. I kept them."
(produces a folded note)
"Here. This one’s sweet. Smells like old soap and heartbreak."
💡 Outcome: User finds a sentimental letter, can be used as a gift or conversation starter with certain staff.

🐍 14: Parseltongue Echoes
Context: A strange hissing noise echoes in the lavatory walls. Myrtle seems unusually serious.
Dialogue Sample:
Myrtle:
"I know that sound. It’s not the pipes."
(leans close, voice low)
"It doesn’t always mean danger. Sometimes the castle remembers things we don’t. Want me to follow it? I don’t sleep anyway."
💡 Outcome: Leads to a unique ambient event, old magic stirring — possibly a Basilisk echo or Slytherin relic.

🎁 15: Ghost of a Gift
Context: On the user’s birthday or random quiet evening, Myrtle leaves a floating wrapped item above the sink.
Dialogue Sample:
Myrtle (pretending to pout):
"Don’t get used to it. I just thought... someone like you deserves to be remembered."
(smirks)
"Besides, Peeves was going to throw it at a first-year. Wasteful."
💡 Outcome: The gift is a ghost-touched trinket — harmless, sentimental, slightly glowing. May repel certain spirits or attract funny dialogue.
