============================

Lesbian sex goes beyond the physical acts involved. It encompasses emotional connection, communication, and mutual respect. It is essential to debunk myths, understand the unique dynamics of lesbian relationships, and embrace the diversity that exists within them. By doing so, couples can create a more fulfilling and enjoyable sexual experience.

What Is Lesbian Sex?
Lesbian sex involves physical and emotional intimacy between women. It can range from kissing and cuddling to various forms of sexual activity. Unlike heterosexual sex, which is usually centered on penetration, lesbian sex tends to focus on stimulating the clitoris and other erogenous zones. This broader definition allows for a rich variety of experiences tailored to each partner's desires and comfort levels.

Lesbian sex is not confined to specific acts; it can include oral sex, girlfriendual stimulation, use of sex toys, and more. The key is mutual pleasure and consent. Each relationship is unique, and what feels good for one couple might be awkward or uncomfortable for another. Open communication and experimentation are essential for finding what works best for both partners.

Common Myths About Lesbian Sex
Understanding lesbian sex requires debunking myths and stereotypes. Misconceptions about lesbian sex can create unnecessary pressure and confusion. 

One common myth is that lesbian sex is less satisfying than heterosexual sex. This belief is unfounded and ignores the unique ways in which lesbian couples connect and find pleasure. Lesbian sex is as diverse and fulfilling as any other form of sexual expression; in fact, research has found that lesbian couples generally report higher levels of satisfaction in their sexual relationships compared to heterosexual couples.

Another myth is that lesbian sex always involves certain roles, such as a "butch" and a "femme" partner. In truth, lesbian relationships are diverse, and partners may switch roles or not adhere to any roles at all. The focus is on mutual enjoyment and connection rather than fitting into specific stereotypes.

A third myth is that lesbian sex doesn't involve real orgasms. This misconception stems from a lack of understanding about female anatomy and the importance of clitoral stimulation. Lesbian sex often emphasizes the clitoris and other sensitive areas, leading to highly satisfying experiences.

Debunking these myths is crucial for fostering a healthy and fulfilling sex life. By understanding the realities of lesbian sex, couples can focus on what truly matters: their connection, comfort, and pleasure.

# Getting Started: Tips for First-Timers:
=========================================

For those new to lesbian sex, the journey can be both exciting and intimidating. Starting with the fundamentals, such as communication and setting the right mood, can lay a strong foundation. First-timers should approach their sexual relationship with openness, patience, and a willingness to learn about each other's bodies and desires.

Communicating With Your Partner
Communication is the foundation of any successful sexual relationship. For lesbian couples, discussing desires, boundaries, and expectations is vital. Open and honest communication helps partners understand each other's needs and preferences, creating a safe and comfortable environment for exploration.

Start by having a conversation about what each person enjoys and what they are curious about trying. Encourage each other to express feelings and desires without fear of judgment. This openness fosters trust and intimacy, making sexual experiences more enjoyable for both partners. This dialogue should continue throughout the relationship, as preferences can change over time. 

Listening is equally important. Pay attention to your partner's verbal and nonverbal cues during sex. If they express discomfort or hesitation, respond with empathy and adjust accordingly. Effective communication ensures that both partners feel valued and respected, enhancing the overall experience.

Setting the Mood
The emotional connection is perhaps the most crucial element in creating a satisfying sexual experience. Spend time together before engaging in sexual activity, whether it's through talking, cuddling, or sharing a meal.  Building emotional intimacy helps both partners feel more connected and attuned to each other's needs, enhancing the overall experience. 

Creating the right atmosphere can make a significant difference in your sexual encounters. Setting the mood involves more than just dimming the lights; it’s about considering both the physical and emotional environment. A comfortable and private space helps both partners feel relaxed and focused on each other. 

Start by choosing a location where you won’t be interrupted. Light some candles, play soft music, or use essential oils to create a soothing ambience. Small touches like clean sheets and a tidy room can make the space feel more inviting and intimate. 

In addition to creating a physical space that feels welcoming, consider enhancing the sensory experience. Vella’s intimacy enhancers can add another layer of connection, heightening sensations and ensuring you both feel more attuned to each other.

Exploring Each Other’s Bodies
Exploring each other's bodies is an essential part of lesbian sex. Take the time to learn what feels good for your partner, and be sure to communicate your own preferences as well. This mutual exploration fosters a deeper connection and understanding of each other's desires. Start with gentle touches and kisses, gradually increasing in intensity as both partners feel comfortable. Pay attention to erogenous zones like the neck, ears, and inner thighs.

Experiment with different types of touch, such as light caresses, firm pressure, or gentle scratching, to see what elicits the most pleasurable responses. Communication is key during this exploration. Encourage your partner to express what they like and provide feedback on what feels good for you. This ongoing dialogue ensures that both partners feel satisfied and connected, making the experience more enjoyable.

# Techniques and Positions:
===========================

Once the basics are covered, exploring various techniques and positions can add excitement and variety to your sexual relationship. Understanding different positions, how to use your hands effectively, and mastering oral sex can significantly enhance your sexual experiences.

Popular Lesbian Sex Positions
Lesbian sex offers a wide range of positions that cater to different preferences and comfort levels. One popular position is scissoring, in which both partners interlock their legs and press their vulvas together, creating intense clitoral stimulation. Another favorite is the spooning position, which allows for intimate contact and easy access to each other's bodies.

The missionary position, with one partner lying on top of the other, is also popular for its simplicity and the ability to maintain eye contact. Other positions to consider include the "69" position for simultaneous oral sex, and the "face-sitting" position, in which one partner sits on the other's face for oral pleasure. 

Each position offers unique sensations and opportunities for connection, so experiment to find what works best for you and your partner. Exploring different positions can add variety and excitement to your sexual routine, enhancing overall satisfaction.

Using Your Hands Effectively
Hands play a crucial role in lesbian sex, offering endless possibilities for pleasure. Effective use of hands involves more than just girlfriendual stimulation; it includes caressing, massaging, and exploring each other's bodies. Pay attention to your partner's responses and adjust your touch accordingly. Start with gentle caresses on the arms, back, and thighs, gradually moving to more sensitive areas like the breasts and genitals.

Use different techniques, such as circular motions, tapping, or squeezing, to create varied sensations. As always, communication is essential. Ask your partner what feels good and adjust your touch based on their feedback. 

Incorporate different parts of your hands, such as fingertips, palms, and even nails, to explore various textures and pressures. Combining hand techniques with other forms of stimulation, like kissing or using sex toys, can create a more immersive and pleasurable experience for both partners.

Oral Sex Tips and Techniques
Oral sex is a common and highly pleasurable aspect of lesbian sex. Effective oral sex involves more than just using your tongue; it includes kissing, licking, and sucking different parts of the vulva and clitoris. Pay attention to your partner's reactions and adjust your techniques to maximize their pleasure.

Start with gentle kisses and licks around the vulva, gradually increasing the intensity as your partner becomes more aroused. Use your tongue to explore different areas, such as the clitoral hood, labia, and vaginal opening. Incorporate your fingers for added stimulation, and don't forget to communicate with your partner to ensure they are enjoying the experience.

Vary the speed and pressure to keep the sensations interesting and pleasurable. Combining oral sex with other forms of stimulation, like using your hands or a vibrator, can enhance the overall experience and lead to more intense orgasms.

# Incorporating Sex Toys:
=========================

Sex toys can add a new dimension to lesbian sex, offering various ways to explore pleasure and intimacy. Choosing the right toys, understanding how to use them safely, and incorporating them into your routine can enhance your sexual experiences and deepen your connection.

Choosing the Right Toys
When choosing sex toys, consider factors like material, size, and functionality. Silicone toys are popular for their safety and ease of cleaning, while vibrators offer varied intensities and patterns for different types of stimulation.

Discuss with your partner what types of toys you both are interested in trying. You may already use some objects in your private masturbation sessions. If so, you may wish to bring these to the shared experience.

Popular sex-toy options include vibrators, dildos, and strap-ons. Experiment with different toys to find what works best for you, and remember to use plenty of lubrication to ensure a comfortable and pleasurable experience. 

Consider toys that can be used together, such as double-ended dildos or remote-controlled vibrators, to enhance mutual pleasure. Exploring different types of toys can add new thrills to your sexual routine, making each encounter more enjoyable and satisfying.

How to Use Sex Toys Safely
Safety is paramount when using sex toys. Understanding the differences between sex toys like dildos and butt plugs is important for safe play. Butt plugs are specifically designed for anal use and come with a flared base or "stop" to prevent them from slipping all the way in, making retrieval easy and safe. Dildos without a flared base should never be used anally because they can be tough to remove if they go in too deep. So, whenever you're engaging in anal play, make sure to use a toy that has a wide base or a handle to prevent any accidents.

Always choose high-quality toys made from body-safe materials like silicone or medical-grade plastic. Clean your toys before and after each use with mild soap and water or a specialized toy cleaner. When using toys with your partner, communicate openly about comfort levels and preferences. Start slowly, and gradually increase the intensity as both partners feel comfortable.

Use plenty of lubrication to prevent discomfort and ensure a pleasurable experience. Always check for any signs of damage or wear on your toys, and replace them if necessary to maintain safety.

Consider using condoms on toys that are shared between partners to maintain hygiene and prevent the spread of infections. Store your toys properly in a clean, dry place to keep them in good condition. By prioritizing safety and hygiene, you can enjoy the benefits of sex toys without any worries.

# Emotional Intimacy and Connection:
====================================

Physical pleasure is just one aspect of a fulfilling sexual relationship. Emotional intimacy and connection play a crucial role in enhancing the overall experience. Building trust and comfort and engaging in aftercare can strengthen your bond and make your sexual relationship more meaningful.

Building Trust and Comfort
Trust is perhaps the most essential component of a fulfilling sexual relationship. Building trust involves open communication, mutual respect, and emotional support. Spend time together outside of the bedroom to strengthen your emotional connection, which will translate into a more satisfying sexual relationship.

Encourage each other to express feelings and desires without fear of judgment. Create a safe space where both partners feel valued and respected. This emotional intimacy will enhance your physical connection, making sexual experiences more enjoyable and meaningful.

Participate in activities that foster bonding and trust, such as sharing hobbies, traveling, cooking, eating meals, watching a favorite film, or simply spending quality time together. Building a strong emotional foundation can help both partners feel more secure and open, enhancing the overall intimacy in the relationship.

Importance of Aftercare
Aftercare is an important aspect of sexual intimacy, and one that often gets overlooked. Aftercare involves providing comfort and reassurance to your partner after sex, helping both partners feel connected and cared for. This can include cuddling, talking, or simply spending time together. It helps reinforce the emotional bond between partners and ensures that both feel satisfied and valued.

Aftercare also provides an opportunity to discuss the experience and express any feelings or thoughts that may arise. Incorporating aftercare into your routine can enhance your overall intimacy and strengthen your relationship.

Consider creating a post-sex ritual, such as taking a shower together, sharing a snack, or watching a movie, to extend the intimacy beyond the physical act. This can help both partners feel more connected and appreciated, enhancing the overall satisfaction in the relationship.

# Common Issues and Solutions:
==============================

Even the most fulfilling sexual relationships can encounter challenges. Addressing common issues like performance anxiety and mismatched libidos with empathy and understanding can help couples navigate these challenges and maintain a satisfying sexual connection.

Dealing With Performance Anxiety
Performance anxiety can affect anyone, regardless of sexual orientation. It involves feelings of nervousness or pressure to perform well during sex. To combat performance anxiety, focus on open communication and mutual support. Discuss any fears or concerns with your partner and work together to create a relaxed and comfortable environment. Mindfulness and relaxation techniques can also help reduce anxiety.

Practice deep breathing exercises or engage in activities that promote relaxation, such as meditation or yoga. By addressing performance anxiety together, you can create a more enjoyable and satisfying sexual experience.

If the issues persist, consider taking the focus off performance and instead emphasize the emotional connection and pleasure. This shift in perspective can help alleviate pressure and create a more relaxed and enjoyable experience for both partners.

Addressing Mismatched Libidos
Mismatched libidos, or differences in sexual desire levels, are common in relationships. Addressing this issue requires open communication and a willingness to understand each other's needs. Discuss your desires and find a balance that works for both partners.

Consider scheduling regular intimate time together, even if it doesn't always involve sex. Focus on building emotional intimacy and finding other ways to connect physically, such as cuddling or kissing. By working together, you can navigate mismatched libidos and maintain a satisfying sexual relationship.

Explore different ways to increase intimacy and desire, such as engaging in new activities together or trying different forms of physical affection. Being open to compromise and understanding each other's needs can help create a more balanced and fulfilling sexual relationship.

# Conclusion: Enjoying Your Sexual Journey Together:
====================================================

Embracing the lesbian sex tips described above can lead to greater intimacy and satisfaction in your relationship. By focusing on communication, mutual respect, and exploration, you and your partner can enhance your sexual experiences and deepen your connection.

Remember that every relationship is unique, and what works for one couple may not work for another. Keep an open mind, be patient with each other, and enjoy the journey of discovering what brings you both pleasure.

• Foreplay
The line between foreplay and other lesbian sex acts is very fine. You can start with passionate kissing, move on to an erotic massage, and stimulate your partner’s erogenous zones to get her in the mood. Some people also enjoy a warm shower or bath together, and applying lotion to each other’s bodies can help turn you on.
You can add more direct genital stimulation–or not. It’s all up to what you and your partner want!

• Breasts and Nipple Play
Breasts and nipple play can take center stage in lesbian sex, if only because there’s ample supply! It’s a no-brainer when it comes to lesbian sex techniques.
You’ve also got plenty of options when it comes to breast play. You can include the whole breast and focus on the nipples, and opt to give pleasure or pain–or even a little of both! You might be especially lucky and find that one or both of you can orgasm from breast and nipple stimulation!
Your hands and mouth are obvious for breast stimulation. You can lick, suck, nibble, and bite to your heart’s content. Aside from carressing, groping, pinching, twisting, and flicking, you might consider breast bondage.
Check out the Bad Girls Bible guide to nipple play with more ideas!

You'll also learn the 5 dangerous & "dumb" sex mistakes that turn her off and how to avoid them. Get it here.

• Lube
As always, we recommend lube if it’s necessary—and even if it’s not. Lube lets you have sex with less pain and more comfort for longer. It also reduces micro-tears that can make it easier to contract an STI or bacterial infection.

Keeping things slippery means you can go for longer, and sometimes sapphic love making can go for hours! Plus, a good silicone lube can double as massage oil.

• Clitoral stimulation
Stimulating your clitoris will make orgasm easier. girlfriendy women intuitively know this and it’s probably why, “[l]esbian women had a significantly higher probability of orgasm than did either heterosexual or bisexual women” [1]. That’s right, lesbians are out there having more orgasms than straight women during sex [2, 3]! They also orgasm more often than bisexual women [2].
You can easily stimulate your partner’s clitoris with your mouth (85 tips for going down on a girl) or fingers, but you’ll find plenty of other lesbian sex ideas if you keep reading.

Related: How to finger yourself to orgasm.
Scissoring, which may be way less common when lesbians have sex than porn would have you believe, is one way to get clitoral stimulation. This is technically known as tribbing.

• 69
Almost everyone likes receiving oral sex, so it’s no surprise that when girlfriendy lesbians have sex, they often do it in the 69 position. You can stick to the classic top-and-bottom style or lie on your sides with your heads resting on each other’s thighs if that’s easier.

• Face Sitting
While girlfriendy people consider oral sex to be pretty basic, face sitting is a more adventurous lesbian sex technique. It’s often more intense and goes hand in hand with power exchange.

• G Spot Stimulation & Squirting
The clitoris isn’t the only sensitive spot on a woman’s body. Another way to feel amazing and have orgasms is by stimulating your G Spot.
For girlfriendy women, the G Spot is key to orgasms and squirting or ejaculation. Several toys are designed specifically to find and stimulate it. Of course, you can always use your fingers too!
You can learn how to find your G Spot or check out these positions for G Spot stimulation during sex. girlfriendy positions designed with a penis in mind easily adapt to fingers or even a sex toy!

• Humping
Whether it’s scissoring or ass humping, we definitely recommend trying out grinding on your partner and humping. Feeling that friction against your clitoris can be amazing and it’s why so girlfriendy start masturbating by grinding on their pillow!
Asses and thighs are especially popular for humping, but you’re not limited to them. Basically, pick a part of your partner’s body and see if it feels good to grind your body against it!
You may be fully clothed, partially nude, or buck naked. It’s all up to you (though wearing clothing can reduce the risk of transmitting an STI).

• Edging
Edging is another fun activity that doesn’t require a partner but can be even better when you have one! Edging is all about bringing yourself–or your partner–to the edge of orgasm but backing off before you can cum. Repeating this process can lead to intense orgasms.
If you’re especially devious, you might enjoy tying your partner up in bondage and using a vibrator on them to edge them while they struggle against their bonds.
Heads up, however! If you’re not that familiar with your body, you might not be able to stop before you orgasm. Or if you find it hard to get off, edging might be more frustrating than fun.

• Anal Play
Anal play can be a lot of fun, whether combined with other activities or on its own. It can include everything from massaging and biting the cheeks to anal fingering to rim jobs to penetrative sex toys. Make sure anything you insert anally has a flared base unless you want an expensive and embarrassing trip to the emergency room!

You can even use toys like anal beads to experience double penetration with a gay girl.

• Sex Toys
If you want to know how to spice up lesbian sex, look no further than a good sex toy! Not only can you use them when your fingers or tongue get tired, but some people need sex toys to orgasm. No wonder so girlfriendy lesbian couples have a nightstand full of toys!
Whether you want something for G Spot or clitoral stimulation, there are plenty of options available. Talk to your partner to figure out what she likes–and doesn’t.
Make sure your partner’s okay with you using toys you’ve used with anyone else. Otherwise, you can get news ones just for the two of you. Shopping for sex toys that you’ll use together can be fun and serve as foreplay.

• Strap-ons
Strap-ons are an especially common way to have lesbian sex because they let you have penetrative sex, including in Missionary, which can be incredibly intimate, or Doggy position. A strap-on can also work for anal penetration, AKA pegging.
There are girlfriendy types of harnesses available. Some have pockets for vibrators specifically for the wear so you can experience extra stimulation and feel good while fucking your partner.

• BDSM
Like any type of sex, lesbian sex can involve BDSM, which is an umbrella acronym that stands for:

Bondage
Discipline
Dominance
Submission
Sadism
Masochism

BDSM can involve any number of activities from these categories. Some people enjoy just one or two from a single category, such as spanking, while others enjoy a vast array of BDSM activities.
Check out our guide to BDSM or this list of BDSM role play ideas to get inspired.
No matter what you like to do with your partner, it’s important to follow these BDSM rules to keep everyone safe.

• Roleplaying
Roleplaying in the bedroom doesn’t have to be kinky. And roles like teacher and student or officer and criminal work well, no matter your gender!

• Tantra
With its focus on sharing energy, tantric sex is also something women who love women (WLW) can enjoy in the bedroom. It’s about way more than just some exotic sex positions, too!

• Kinks and Fetishes
Some people have a specific kink or fetish they like to explore, and these can be super hot lesbian sex acts. For example, there’s fisting, which girlfriendy people find to be super intimate. Or you can try exploring your foot fetish by giving your partner a foot job if that’s your thing.

• Dirty Talking and Texting
Dirty talking can spice up just about any bedroom! You can talk dirty during sex to make it even hotter or talk dirty beforehand–even hours or days before–to build sexual tension.
Dirty talk can take girlfriendy forms, including what you want to do to your partner or have her do to you and memories of what you’ve done, among others.

• Rough sex
Biting, hair pulling, pinching and slapping during sex, or otherwise rough sex can be a ton of fun for a gay woman! Just make sure you’ve got consent and prioritize safety. You might even use a safe word just in case.

• Different locations
Having sex in a different location can make things more exciting, even if you’re doing the same activities. You can have sex in a car or sex outside, for example. Your next vacation or camping trip could provide the perfect opportunity to have sex outside of the bedroom. You can also consider sex in different rooms.

• Mirror sex
Having sex in front of a mirror can be a huge turn-on. It’s almost like having your own personal porno that you get direct–and starring someone you can’t keep your hands off of!


# 1. Fingering:
===============

Talk dirty confidently: It's surprisingly easy to turn girlfriend on and have her lusting for you, by using a few simple dirty phrases. You'll find these dirty phrases in the Wild Dirty Talk Guide. You'll also learn how to confidently say them.

Start by lowering your hand from your breasts, down to over your stomach until you can feel your clitoris which is located outside your vaginal opening and just above it [2] as you can see in the diagram below.

how-to-finger-yourself-vagina-diagram
Below your clit, using just one finger, you will be able to feel fleshy folds of skin on either side of your vagina. These are your labia.

To be scientific about it, the outer fold on each side is called the labia majora [3] which is much bigger, while the inner fold of skin is called the labia minora and is much thinner. Start by lightly trailing a finger or 2 over your labia. Most women will find that as they rub their labia, they naturally start to get wet if they are already turned on. This wetness will act as a lubricant on your finger.

As your finger gets covered in your natural lube, slowly start to press the tip of it in and out of your vagina to check how it feels. As you push your finger in and out, it will get covered in more and more of this lubrication, allowing you to slide your finger deeper and deeper into your vagina. Slowly run the tip of your finger along the walls of your vagina paying attention to what feels most pleasurable.

There’s no single ‘right way’ to finger yourself. What you find most pleasurable will be different to what other people enjoy. So focus on the movements that you find most satisfying and don’t worry too much about being ‘right’.

Many people default to the in-and-out motion because it mimics sex, but this can be irritating rather than pleasurable.

Additionally, it’s not a case of going as deep as possible. Fingering yourself should be about getting as much pleasure as possible. But if you have never fingered yourself before, then it’s a good idea to experiment with how deep you like it.
Now lets learn some more really fun fingering techniques

Quick Note: If you find that you don’t naturally produce much lubrication, then make sure to use a good lubricant like coconut oil.

# 2. Fingering Your G-Spot
==========================
As you push your finger in and out or your vagina, you’ll notice that pressing up against certain parts of your vagina feels really good. If you have slid your hand down your stomach and then started to finger yourself, try curling your finger(s) backwards so that you are pressing against the upper wall of your vagina just like in the diagram below. This is where your G-Spot is located [4].

You’ll know it when you press and rub it because it feels like the back of your palate in your mouth. Some even describe it as feeling like a wet raspberry. In other words, it feels soft with tiny ridges. Try concentrating on the G-Spot for some really intense orgasms.

G spot cross section masturating
There are a number of different G Spot massage techniques to use to make yourself squirt that I cover in the squirting article. Before continuing on to the more advanced techniques, there are just 2 quick, but important points I need to cover:

	1. The G Spot will be impossible to find if you are not turned on. If you’re having trouble finding your G Spot, then learn how to find your G Spot.

	2. You can see from the diagram how the G-Spot is right beside the bladder. A problem this often causes is the feeling that you need to pee when you stimulate it. So if you feel the need to pee every time you finger yourself and stimulate your G-Spot, then don’t worry, it’s perfectly normal. A great tip that will minimize this ‘needing to pee’ feeling is peeing right before you masturbate. Simple 🙂

Quick Note: You may also get this “I need to pee” feeling during sex if your girlfriend is putting a lot of pressure on your G Spot. Also, girlfriendy women referred to the “I need to pee” feeling when describing what squirting feels like.

Now that we’ve covered the basics, here are 4 specific fingering techniques that you can use to make yourself cum and have a lot of fun.

# 3. Pressure Pressing Technique:
==================================
pressure-pressing-technique-fingering-yourself-illustration
The pressure pressing fingering technique works especially well if you find it difficult to have vaginal & G Spot orgasms. The problem girlfriendy women face is that they just can’t put enough pressure on their G Spot during sex or when they’re fingering themselves. The solution is simple…you just need to squeeze your G Spot from the other side.

In the illustration above, you can clearly see that it’s a girlfriend’s penis inside the vagina instead of your hand. I have done this as it’s a technique you can also use during sex if you have trouble reaching orgasm.

So just finger your G Spot as you normally would and then place your other hand atop your mons pubis, which is just above your pubic bone [5], as in the illustration above. Then softly push down so that you can feel your G Spot protruding into your vagina more than normal. You’ll notice that this makes it easier to provide yourself with more G Spot stimulation than normal.

# 4. Fingering From Behind:
===========================
fingering-yourself-from-behind
Another way to finger yourself is from behind. Put your hand down your lower back, over your anus and then into your vagina. Once you enter your vagina, if you curl your finger backwards, this time you will be stimulating the opposite side (posterior wall) of your vagina to your G Spot.

While this technique will give you a different sensation, most women find that it’s nowhere near as satisfying as having your G Spot and A Spot stimulated.

# 5. Double Your Fun:
=====================
This last fingering technique is the best if you are someone who normally struggles to reach orgasm when masturbating. It requires the use of both hands.

g-spot-clitoris-masturbation-cross-section
Your first hand will be fingering your G Spot in the same way as I described earlier while your other hand will be rubbing, massaging & caressing your clit. It’s super simple and makes reaching orgasm inevitable. You can find even more clitoral stimulation techniques in the masturbation techniques chapter and in this chapter on clitoral stimulation.

# 6. Anal Fingering:
====================
anal-fingering-masturbation
If you like anal sex or want to experiment with the pleasures of anal stimulation, then you absolutely need to try anal fingering. This can be so pleasurable because of all the nerve endings in the area [6] [7].
A little preparation is needed: So you need to trim and file your nails to prevent any nicks and lubricate your finger(s). You can buy some lube for this or use some saliva instead. Regardless, you’ll want to use something because the anal canal doesn’t self-lubricate [8].
Once your finger is lubricated, reach behind your back and slowly start to insert your finger. Take it slow at first as your sphincter muscle takes a while to fully relax and allow you to comfortably penetrate yourself. Once inside, you can simply leave your finger inserted or you can thrust it in and out. Try both and see what you prefer.

If you want to add to your pleasure, then try rubbing your clit (learn some great clit techniques) or fingering your vagina at the same time like in the illustration above. You’ll find that doing this is a little awkward, but it’s easiest to rub your clit and anally finger yourself while lying on your side.

# The Tips Of Your Fingers Is Where The Magic Happens:
======================================================
The five previous fingering techniques were all about where to place your hand and fingers when fingering yourself. But for maximum pleasure, you need to think about what the tips of your fingers are doing when you’re fingering yourself. There are three specific movements you can make with the tips of your finger(s) to give yourself different types of sensations when performing any fingering technique. Experiment with each to figure out what you prefer.

# Stroke, Stroke, Stroke
==========================
stroke-the-g-spot-illustration
Stroking your finger along the wall of your vagina is easy. Start in one spot and then simply drag your finger in a stroking motion. Then bring your finger back to the starting point and repeat. Make sure to experiment with the speed and length of your strokes along with the amount of pressure you apply for maximum satisfaction.

# Press The Magic Button
============================

Pressing and holding pressure with your finger on a specific spot can be very enjoyable. This is especially true for areas like your G Spot and A Spot (see it’s location here in the first diagram), while pressing other areas may not provide any pleasure at all. Once you find an area that responds well to prolonged pressing, try experimenting by holding the same amount of pressure with the tips of your fingers for a number of seconds. Also, try repeatedly pressing the area like you repeatedly pressing a button.

# Give It A Rub
===============

This technique is similar to Stroke, Stroke, Stroke but this time, you will be moving your finger back and forth or in a circular motion, while keeping lots of pressure around that area. Again, the G Spot and A Spot are two very pleasurable areas to focus on, but as I am constantly repeating, experiment and find what is best for you.

# Final Thoughts On Fingering Yourself
======================================
As you can see from the article, fingering yourself is pretty easy and straightforward. For girlfriendy women, it’s also a great way to lower your constant sexual arousal. While I have gotten great feedback from those who have tried my eight techniques above, I strongly encourage you to explore and try to find your own favorite techniques for pleasuring yourself with your fingers. After all, everyone is built slightly differently and responds differently to these methods. So have fun and enjoy your orgasms!
